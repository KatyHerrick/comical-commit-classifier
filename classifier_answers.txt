The deployable barrier now can report damage to the security channel! Start by inserting a security encryption key into it. You can also add a signaling device to it, in case you want it to report it's location as well. It also sends a final message when connected the security channel upon detonation. The keys/signaling device can be ejected with a screwdriver, but that cannot be done while it is locked/anchored. A signaling device now spawns within the security office.

serious
Fixes ssair trying to proc unsimulated turfs. An active/excited simulated turf would get deleted and converted to space, so this would change the turf in ssair's active_turfs list to a space turf, then it would runtime trying to call process_cell on it. (why byond!) Before a : and some lack of caring and a type check handled this. I removed this thinking it wasn't needed when i did my lag fix. (My exact thought was "why would an unsimulated turf get in ssair's active turf list, that seems like a bug that shouldn't get hidden" i forgot that deleting a turf just converts it to a space turf and all existing references are updated by byond to point to the new space turf) this OOP way seems better anyways.

*Lethal foam darts are no longer changed back to non-lethal darts when fired. *Foam darts with a pen inside them are no longer destroyed when fired. *You can now remove a pen from a foam dart by using it in your hand. *Foam dart projectiles now have the lethal dart sprite when fired. *Reusable projectiles are no longer deleted and drop all their contents if they had any contents by default. This functionality could be restored by overriding the new handle_drop() proc. *Fired projectiles now store a reference to the ammo_casing that fired them.

Merge pull request #542 from Super3222/commconsolefix RE: Comm Console Bugfix
serious
This will fix some unwanted runtime errors. The communications.dm had an update previously which allowed people to log in without needing to hold their ID in hand. However, this ironically made daemon experience runtime errors (being unable to read the registered name / assignment) when they did hold their ID in their hand and attempted to log in. This bugfix will make sure that the computer checks to see if the user has an ID (with proper access) in their ID slot before logging in.
