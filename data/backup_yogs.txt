 Buffs Floroacid and cyanide to not suck balls Floroacid got nerfed from being ridiculously OP to basically the equivilent of having a lemon thrown at you. Floroacid is now potent, but not extremely lethal like it once was, so that it's still a credible threat, but not as obnoxious as acid spraybottles once were station killers. Cyanide is now not complete horseshit for all the difficulty it takes to make, and will probably kill people in less than four fucking hours.
 So 'bout them greytides.

 Merge branch 'dev' of https://github.com/yogstation13/yogstation into SecurityBarrierBuffVersion2
 The deployable barrier now can report damage to the security channel! Start by inserting a security encryption key into it. You can also add a signaling device to it, in case you want it to report it's location as well. It also sends a final message when connected the security channel upon detonation. The keys/signaling device can be ejected with a screwdriver, but that cannot be done while it is locked/anchored. A signaling device now spawns within the security office.

 Merge pull request #630 from MrStonedOne/patch-1 Fixes ssair trying to proc unsimulated turfs.
 remove_from_active now handles unsimulated turfs properly (because if they are in the active turf list, they should get removed!)
 Fixes ssair trying to proc unsimulated turfs. An active/excited simulated turf would get deleted and converted to space, so this would change the turf in ssair's active_turfs list to a space turf, then it would runtime trying to call process_cell on it. (why byond!) Before a : and some lack of caring and a type check handled this. I removed this thinking it wasn't needed when i did my lag fix. (My exact thought was "why would an unsimulated turf get in ssair's active turf list, that seems like a bug that shouldn't get hidden" i forgot that deleting a turf just converts it to a space turf and all existing references are updated by byond to point to the new space turf) this OOP way seems better anyways.

 Merge pull request #308 from Cruix/Lube_Color Space Lube Nerf 1
 Adds tactical dolphin *available to nukeops for 20TC, with the same spawning process as syndicate cyborg. *can fly around space with no problems like any other dolphin. *like all simple mobs, it is immune to most stuns. *100 health, 15 melee damage. *heals 5 health from each bite of a syndicake, comes with 5 syndicakes. *has an unremovable syndicate headset. *comes wearing a removable harness. While wearing the harness, the dolphin has: *toggleable emag and night vision. *inventory the size of a backpack. The dolphin cannot put items in it, but any human can through the strip menu. The only way to remove items are to have the dolphin drop them, or remove the harness, which takes a human 6 seconds. *laser that shoots swarmer speed (once every 3 life ticks) and never runs out of charge. It has support for multiple weapons it can cycle through, but there is only the one installed by default.

 Merge pull request #326 from Cruix/fix_cyborg_ui Fixes Cyborg UI buttons
 Stolen alot of code from /tg/ made by ChangelingRain: - Blobs can block atmos: Strong blobs and core do that. - Blobs made more explosion resistant, core immune to bombs. - Split Consciousness requires a node under it. - Blob can expand on lattices. Small explosion optimizations, about 8-10% faster.
 If there is another active overmind with a core when your core is destroyed, you don't die. Go help out the other guy! You earn resources from Resource nodes normally and can build stuff. Can't Split/Relocate if you don't have a core.

 1. Fixes is_same DNA not checking species equality correctly. 2. Changelings no longer drop their "flesh" (imitation items) when they monkeyize. 3. Transformation now correctly applies hair/eye color/etc (still no underwear though). 4. If you DNA sting/Absorb someone whose DNA you already have, you refresh that profile (basically means you get their current clothes).
 Oh, and here's the icon for the PDA.

 1. Mechs start with Super Capacity battery (20k charge) instead of some weird manually modified basic cell. 2. On changing battery, mech retains the removed batteries percentage charge.

 Syndicate borgs can now use their grenade launchers.

 Merge pull request #115 from X-TheDark/DroneDoorPass Drones pass through doors (+surprise)
 Manually merged pull request 74 by X-TheDark.
 Made Wizard Shuttle a bit more shadowling friendly. Wizard shuttle now has a bunch of lights on it, instead of being full-bright. There's also a light switch near the magic mirror. Also some tweaks to shadowlings to make sure wizards can't get those goodies intentionally put out of reach. Basically makes a shadowling wizard a viable option.
 Removes shadowling and plasmaman from magic mirror race option Should fix #116 so dumdum wizards don't die on their shuttle Inb4 this breaks the game I'm not a coder
 Merge pull request #114 from X-TheDark/GolemStripFix Fixes Golem ID/Belt/Pockets not being removable.
 Merge pull request #111 from Groudonmaster/patch-1 Add Req_admin_notify to Cyborg.
 Shadowling Tweaks Removed Toggles for Dark Vision and Shadow Walk Made Shadowlings, Ascendants, and Statues always shadow-walk. Made it so Shadowlings (And observers and such) can tell the difference between light tiles and pure black tiles. Fixed things not rotating when pulled around in darkness with shadowwalk.
 Shortened description.
 Drones now pass through doors with the added PASSDOOR flag as well as checks on Doors (Doors/Window Doors, but not firedoors and such). As a bonus, a certain unique corgi can now pass through doors as well. FUN.
 Golems can now have their Belt/ID/Pocket items removed.
 Add Req_admin_notify to Cyborg. Majority of players don't realize they need to notify about this role. Obviously will help with that.

 Made it so that bullet_act() is always called when bots are hit by a projectile. This means that foam force darts and other reusable ammo fired at bots no longer disappear. Also made Mulebots process projectiles properly again, since they depended on the old code on bots/bullet_act().
 Fixed some bot interface buttons being usable when they should not be. Made Beepsky's siren non-toggleable unless Beepsky is unlocked.

 Stop chemicals reacting with light effects. This was technically a bug for longer than we had my lighting system, but it wasn't noticable until we changed the default colour state of light tiles.
