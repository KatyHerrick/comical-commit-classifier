 Improved dialog centring Password requests from the tx dialog box are now centred on the tx dialog. Similarly for error messages if misentering the password. Also, "Signing transaction..." and "Broadcasting transaction..." are centred on the appropriate tx dialog. Finally restore the old "Sign" button enabling / disabling, as we can now tell if the user cancelled the password request.
 Improved password wrapper. Doesn't require any particular argument order of the wrapped function. Caller can tell if the user cancelled the request or not. Optionally handles parent window hints.
 Rename send_tx() to sign_tx() Because it signs, and it doesn't send.
 Show the broadcast button even if broadcast. It may not actually be broadcast or relayed for various reasons.
 Prevent garbage collection of TxDialogs The transaction dialogs have a habit of randomly disappearing, because of garbage collection. This was particularly common if you viewed the details of a tx in your history immediately after electrum startup, or after pressing Broadcast. Other tweaks: - Distinguish saved and broadcast. - When signed, consider unsaved and prompt to save if not subsequently saved or broadcast. - Hide broadcast button after broadcast. - Hook into the closeEvent so closing the window with the mouse has the same effect as pressing the close button.
 Merge pull request #1342 from kyuupichan/retain_user_fees Once a user inputs a fee, retain it.
 Once a user inputs a fee, retain it. It has long been a minor annoyance that this isn't the default behaviour. Semantics are as follows: - Fees are calculated automatically, as usual, and shown in black - If the user inputs a fee, it is retained, and shown in blue to indicate it is user-overridden - The user can switch back to automatic fee calculation mode in two ways: press Clear, or blank out the fee field - User fees are also cleared by do_clear(), for instance when the payment is sent I have checked all usage combinations I could think of, including the ! case, and all work in a sensible and natural fashion. This also fixes issue #995.

 Merge pull request #1314 from kyuupichan/tx_dialog2 Have show-before-broadcast defer password request
 Have show-before-broadcast defer password request Show-before-send currently asks for the password and creates a signed tx before showing anything. This is a little unnerving as you can't see what you're being asked to sign. This patch does a few things: - Adds a description label to the TX dialog - You see the tx before being asked for password; that is only requested on pressing Sign - in show-before-broadcast mode, the Send button text is instead "Show...". Hook up this button text change to the prefs dialog too. - Remove many redundant imports. In particular PyQ4 is checked in main_window.py so no need in tx_dialog too. Note I had to remove disabling of the Sign button, because if the user presses "cancel" nothing will re-enable it.

 Make the synchronizer not a thread. The synchronizer's work is done from the network proxy's main loop. A minor problem with the old synchronizer was that it considered itself out of date if the network was out of date. This was too generic: the network can have pending requests unrelated to the synchronizer. This resulted in the synchronizer often unnecessarily flipping the wallet between up-to-date and not-up-to-date, and causing unnecessary calls to wallet.save_transactions(). This was observable when opening the network dialog box: frequently just opening it would cause a wallet status change and transaction flush, simply because the network dialog sends a get_parameters() request. This rework of the synchronizer does not have that issue.

 Have transaction_dialog use send_tx() This is working towards showing transactions before asking for passwords. I think it also means the transaction dialog now interacts properly with plugins, whereas it didn't before. send_tx now takes a callback instead of a label, and does not decide on whether to broadast itself; that is left to its caller. broadcast_transaction() takes care of adding the description of the successfully broadcast transaction to the wallet. Previously labels could be added to the wallet even if the broadcast was cancelled by the user or unsuccessful, which doesn't seem right. Lengthen the dialog messages a little, as some window managers lose the "Please Wait" title bar owing to window decorations if the message is too short.

 SocketPipe shouldn't close the socket. This is a layering violation - the SocketPipe doesn't own the socket and provides no other way to close the socket, leading to unnecessary complexity like that in interface.py. I looked at deamon.py and NetworkProxy - the two other users, and they don't close the sockets explicitly, just let them be garbage collected.

 Make the blockchain class not a thread Remove interface communication out of blockchain.py into network.py. network.py handles protocol requests for headers and chunks. blockchain.py continues to handle their analysis and verification. If an interface provides a header chain that doesn't connect, it is dismissed, as per a previous TODO comment. This removes a thread and another source of timeouts. I see no performance issues with this when truncating the blockchain. Rename 'result' to 'header' for clarity.

 Merge pull request #1267 from kyuupichan/spendable_coins get_spendable_coins and frozen addrs
 get_spendable_coins and frozen addrs Two callers of get_spendable_coins were removing frozen addrs before calling. Put that functionality in the function. We shouldn't be able to send_from a frozen address. This was possible in the current release because logic assumed a two-element tuple was returned when it is now three-element. Fix that too. Command line options listunspent and createrawtransaction currently ignore frozen addresses. I'm not sure that's right but I've preserved that behaviour. With this patch only the wallet class refers to self.frozen_addresses; other clients use is_frozen() now.
 fix: freeze does not need password
 Merge pull request #1266 from kyuupichan/fast_freezing Speed up freezing and unfreezing of many addresses
 Speed up freezing and unfreezing of many addresses Speedup mainly from writing to storage only once. Make frozen_addresses a set in memory, as sets give cleaner code and are more efficient. Minor change in behaviour: command line freezing used to return False if the address isn't in the wallet OR the address was already frozen. Now it returns more like a success code: it returns False only if the address isn't in the wallet regardless of frozen state. Similarly for unfreezing.

 Remove pending_servers, self.interfaces is now the complete set of interfaces we have created. Existing code has the concept of pending servers, where a connection thread is started but has not sent a connection notification, and and interfaces which have received the notification. This separation caused a couple of minor bugs, and given the cleaner semantics of unifying the two I don't think the separation is beneficial. The bugs: 1) When stopping the network, we only stopped the connected interface threads, not the pending ones. This would leave Python hanging on exit if we don't make them daemon threads. 2) start_interface() did not check pending servers before starting a new thread. Some of its callers did, but not all, so it was possible to initiate two threads to one server and "lose" one thread. Apart form fixing the above two issues, unification causes one more change in semantics: we are now willing to switch to a connection that is pending (we don't switch to failed interfaces). I don't think that is a problem: if it times out we'll just switch again when we receive the disconnect notification, and previously the fact that an interface was in the interaces dictionary wasn't a guarantee the connection was good anyway: we might not have processed a pending disconnection notification.

Previously anything in the system config would be unmodifiable. This patch fixes these and cleans the code up a bit. I noticed this whilst attempting to unify the 'auto_cycle' setting.

 Flush wallet storage once for a sequence of puts. This speeds up save_transactions by 2 to 3 times for me.
 Prevent race with two electrum instances on same wallet. Whilst it's not a good idea to have two electrum instances open on the same wallet, we should avoid throwing an exception. Also note how the old code's handling of the exception (caused by both renaming the file almost at the same time, rather than a non-POSIX system not supporting the atomic rename) can lead to the wallet file being lost enirely because os.remove(self.path) succeeds and the rename of the temporary no-longer-existing file then fails.

Furthermore, two other callers of switch_to_interface do not do explicit is_connected() checks before calling it.

 Merge pull request #1224 from kyuupichan/netstartstop Put common network start and stop code in one place.
 Consistency in handling of self.interface switch_to_interface() becomes the common place where self.interface is set; therefore self.interface is not None precisely when self.default_server is connected. Previously some places required it to be connected and some didn't. Also an interface change now sends the 'updated' notification consistently - previously some did and some didn't. Have network_start() call start_interfaces() - this also means network restarts now do this. Fix apparent off-by-one in start_interfaces()
 Put common network start and stop code in one place. Prefer to use safer self.is_connected() as it checks interface is not None. Using common code gives small observable changes in behaviour: - slightly different print_error() messages - network restarts now enter status 'connecting' which they didn't before, which seems correct - status 'connecting' is done with set_status() rather than simply assigning the status, which seems more correct. Now that the response_queue is available in the constructor this works; it used to fail with 'response_queue is not defined'

 Merge pull request #1210 from venzen/master gui/text.py curses GUI bug fixes
 Convert old latin1 labels, Raise exception if json conversion fails. A couple of changes 1) Old electrum wallets seemed to save labels in latin1, when you call json.dumps on line 83/84 it fails silently, which causes the label import to fail. Whenever electrum saves, it then overwrites your default wallet with no labels - essentially deleting all your labels. The solution to this is iterating over all the labels for old wallets decoding anything that fails to unicode() as latin1, and then unicoding it :) 2) Failing to import data and then deleting it is bad. So I'm raising an exception to avoid data being lost.

 Merge pull request #1205 from kyuupichan/if-cleanup-final Fix two races in interface.py.
 Remove wallet.get_transactions() Because references are returned, it's not threadsafe as ThomasV pointed out.
 Fix two races in interface.py. First, close the socket from the thread itself rather than from the stop() function. This prevents another thread closing the socket that the interface thread is simultaneously using. Second, it occasionally would happen that the parent thread such as network.py start() an interface, do a send_request() and timeout waiting for a response (timeouts are 0.1s). It would check is_connected(), get False, and assume the connection has failed. In fact the thread hadn't even been scheduled or gotten around to completing the socket connection. Fix by having self.connected start out True. If the connection fails or times out, we set connected to False soon enough. Finally for correctness we need to deepcopy a send_request() rather than take a reference to it.
 Move the verified and unverified txs to the wallet.

 Merge pull request #1202 from kyuupichan/offline-1 Preparation for moving the set of verified and unverified txs to the wallet
 Preparation for moving the set of verified and unverified txs to the wallet. The verifier will retain responsibility for verification, but will no longer hold the transaction sets itself. Change requires_fee to take a wallet. Add new function add_unverified_tx() Move get_confirmations() to the wallet from the verifier.

 Remove self.lock It is now unused; all necesary locking is done by the Queue objects.
 Merge pull request #1194 from kyuupichan/if-cleanup5 Send requests only from the interface thread.
 Send requests only from the interface thread. Currently requests are sent from the requestor's thread. The lock is not properly held where necessary so this is not thread-safe. For example it can race with the thread stopping and closing the socket the requestor is trying to use to send with. Resolve such races by having send_request() simply queue the requests, which are asynchronously sent from the interface thread itself.
 Merge pull request #1193 from kyuupichan/if-cleanup4 Move ping functionality into its own function.
 Move ping functionality into its own function. First step in cleaning up the run() function. Calls stop() rather than setting is_connected to False on case of timeout, which cleanly closes the socket.
 Merge pull request #1192 from kyuupichan/if-cleanup3 Pass the response_queue to the constructor, not start().

 First of several incremental patches tightening up interface.py. Remove some unneeded imports, a constant and a line of dead code. Document the current external API interface.py provides.
 Use TLS for LabelSync
 Move away from requiring network and blockchain objects to be able to request local height. We store it in the config object instead of in the blockchain object. The blockchain object now refers to its config, and calls refresh_height() to update it. The network objects also refer to the config rather than the blockchain. This is the first of many small steps to untangle the verifier from stored state and so permit the history tab to work in offline mode. The refactoring will simultaneously clean up a lot of accumulated cruft.

 Make stretch column editable again.
 Remove two redundant refreshes of history tab during startup. The call to update_wallet() is redundant with earlier call to load_wallet(). Set the need_update boolean so the timer will refresh rather than unconditionally refreshing. This typically results in it merging with the first network "updated" event resulting in one less refresh. For me in online mode this results in history being calculated and shown only twice during startup rather than four times.

 Merge branch 'master' into tray_tip_wallet
 Avoid ugly flash of small window during startup. Electrum 2.x flashes a small window during startup before the main window appears. This turns out to be the fee edit box being enabled in create_send_tab(). Setting it to visible when the grid containing it is unparented causes QT to actually display a window with just the edit box widget for some reason. So defer the call to set its visibility until the grid is parented.
 Remove apparenlty dead import and __builtin__ assignment. Googling reveals this code is likely a remnant of prior code and no longer needed. It appears to have no effect on my system.
 Should have been setup-release.py
 Determine is_local not based on cwd but on existence of setup-release.py The goal is to be able to run local instances from arbitrary directories. It seems that the chances of having a setup-release.py in the same directory as an installed electrum are extremely remote: not only is the name unusual, but the file isn't installed anyway.

 Merge pull request #987 from dabura667/fixcsvhistory Fix the line terminator in csv
 update packaging scripts
 Fix the line deliminator in csv currently the csv output is `\r\r\n` where the line terminator is `\r\n` and the extra `\r` is probably being inserted from writing a dict to csv. I get around this by changing the line terminator to `\n` to output `\r\n` which will make it compatible with most spreadsheet apps.

 Merge pull request #899 from Tafelpoot/qrcode_fix2 QR code fixes
 QR code fixes New classes ScanQRTextEdit and ShowQRTextEdit. Reason: dependencies on zbar availability and issues with the QRTextEdit constructor. - ScanQRTextEdit needs access to the config (fetch camera). It needs to load the zbar processor properly before trying to scan. Keeping a reference to the processor in qrscaner fixes the crashes on windows. - ShowQRTextEdit should not have access to scan_qr(). - no need to setReadOnly anymore. It is clear from the class name. Show master pub keys now has a Combobox if multiple accounts are available.

 Merge pull request #878 from imrehg/fee Fix "Invalid Fee" issue when start with fiat in send (exchange rate plugin)
 Fix "Invalid Fee" issue when start with fiat in send (exchange rate plugin) Problem: Using the exchange rate plugin in the send dialog one can start with entering a fiat amount, e.g. 5 USD, and the BTC amount is updated, but no fee is calculated. In this case can get "Invalid fee" error until the BTC amount is touched manually and fee is calculated. This can cause confusion when "set transaction fees manually" is disabled. Reproducing: * enable exchange rate plugin * start Electrum * in send dialog fill out any receive address * add a value (e.g. 5) into the fiat dialog and see the BTC value filled out * fee is not filled out, or if disabled the manual transaction fees then directly get "Invalid Fee" error Expectation: * Fees are calculated just as it would be by filling out the BTC field Fix: Fixed by triggering a fee setting the same way as it is done when the BTC field is edited, by calling `textEdited.emit("")` of the relevant `BTCAmountEdit` element. One problematic thing is that this also triggers a change on the fiat we just edited, and thus cursor positions need to be saved and restored. This is not ideal, there should be a way to avoid such cascades and trigger fee calculation directly instead of by proxy. Editing the fiat field with these changes is more or less okay, there can be some strange steps when the decimal point is edited, but IMHO not worse than the BTC field when the decimal point is edited there.

 Merge pull request #634 from dpdtex/FiatPrice Show Current Fiat Price in Status Panel
 Streamlined code - modified two procs (get_fiat_status_text and fiat_dialog) to call exchange API only once instead of twice (as recommended by wozz).
 Cleaned up Exchange Rate plugin: more efficient code and more intuitive names for the get fiat balance/price procedures. Created new procedure used for updating the fiat balance & price on the status panel. Enhancement: status panel on bottom left now shows the current BTC price (eg, 1 BTC~573.45 USD).
 Merge pull request #632 from dpdtex/FixAccountComboWidth Fixed bug with width of account combo box on bottom right.
 Fixed size issue on account combo box in status panel. If you started Electrum with a wallet that did not have imported keys (therefore the account combo box didn't show), then you opened a wallet that had imported keys, the combo box was not wide enough to correctly display the combo box items.

 Merge pull request #497 from pitchforks/pip-install-user fix setup.py to make `pip install --user` possible in Linux
 Merge pull request #498 from shunyata/bugfix/old-param-in-update_password Remove an obsolete parameter.
 wallet.synchronizer should exist at construction. The `self.synchronizer` attribute is accessed before it ever exists when using `electrum importprivkey` on the command line. This change sets it to None, which is a valid state, in the wallet's constructor.
 Remove an obsolete parameter. This was straight-up crashing before. Need more automated tests, I think. :/
 fix setup.py to make `pip install --user` possible in Linux added one more fallback to a local directory inside user's HOME, because /usr/share/electrum for Linux was hardcoded in lib/util.py - see function appdata_dir()

 Add a number of standard keyboard shortcuts to menu items in the Qt UI, especially under the File menu. To make action names more conventional, rename "Create/Restore" to "New/Restore", "Copy" to "Save Copy", and "Close" to "Quit". This also resolves the situation where Create/Restore, Copy and Close all had "C" as their mnemonic. Also allow fast switching between tabs by using Alt+[1-5], same as in tabbed web browsers. Ctrl+PgUp/PgDown is still available.
 Merge pull request #476 from shunyata/bugfix/parsing-error-in-csv-transaction Bugfix/parsing error in csv transaction
 Parse amounts from CSV with Decimal and not float. This fixes a bug where amounts are read from a CSV file incorrectly due to floating point representation error. For example, the string 0.009 will be parsed as 0.00899999, and then converted to 899999, resulting in one fewer satoshi being sent as part of the transaction generated from the CSV file.
 Remove trailing whitespace.

 Merge pull request #462 from imrehg/posfix pointofsale: generated bitcoin url might contain invalid characters
 pointofsale: generated bitcoin url might contain invalid characters The bitcoin invoice url generated for the QR code might contain illegal characters because the labels can have any text. In default it already contains spaces (ie. the naming convention "Invoice - 0001"). The invalid URL did confuse e.g. the Bitcoin Wallet Android app, that couldn't read bitcoin addresses from the generated QR code. This is fixed by escaping the label text before displaying it as a QR code.

 Merge branch 'fallback'
 Dump problem tx to temporary file when error happens. This allows developers to debug failed transactions from users by having access to the raw tx dump to see what is wrong. This would useful in the pro-mode GUI. There should be implemenation for the send method between both these GUIs rather than having their own copy-pasted version. Also the fee system needs fixing.
 Reworked the qt warning dialog
 Refactored user_dir to utils and replaced it in wallet and config
 Added a set_key setter method that can also write out the changes to file

 Fix merge conflict with master
 Fixed issue 19 by jimboman77: https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/issues/19 "Right now the only check thats being done is making sure that the length isn't 0, ie something is being entered before the send button becomes clickable." Also check that entered amount is <= btc_balance before enabling send button.
 If wallet does not exist, then it does not even attempt to read the config (read returns on IOError exception). Ergo a new wallet will not ever set the theme name and it will stay as None. We change this to a sensible default so new wallets have a themed GUI.
 Remove assert which isn't true for the commands (only the GUI).
 WalletSynchronizer had a race condition caused by calling the callback before the Qt event loop (or other initialisation) finished. Ergo we split initialisation and the running of the thread, then use Qt SIGNALs to yield back into the Qt event loop. This ensures that the callback for the servers_list_changed is not called until the main Qt event loop is actually running.
 Tidy up of code to comply with style guide.

 Select unused addresses when copying receiving address.

 hotfix for new wallet.register_callback compat
 Password input dialog working.
 Added send functionality. Still needs to have the password dialog, and final testing.
 spawn both guis at start. clicking expand hides the simple one, shows the expert one.
 spawning electrum gui works if i hide widget and create it. better would be to create both at the startup and hide the inactive one. they need a way to share the wallet though.
 created expand stub. doesn't work trying to spawn electrum gui (segfault)
 Actions for app_menu (report bug, show about electrum, quit app)
 Update balance under accounts selector.
 SIGNALs should use the correct syntax for names of "foo()", not "foo"
 bugfix for "QObject: Cannot create children for a parent that is in a different thread."
 Enforce minimum width of address input so it's ~ same size as a bitcoin address.
 basic functionality: - can type in address field which is validated - amount field uses a validator - copy bitcoin address for receiving funds - send copied over (untested - needs work)
