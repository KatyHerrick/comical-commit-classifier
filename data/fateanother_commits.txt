 Revert "Updated Saber Alter to show Mana Catalyst's counter" This reverts commit 9e5daf4e08a8c0581570d8ff5ccbdb8469f164d6. Conflicts: scripts/vscripts/saber_alter_ability.lua
 Remove debug variable
 Updated Saber Alter to show Mana Catalyst's counter This update is for the user to be able to see the exact stack of Mana Catalyst he/she has before actually spending it. It is shown via Derange's passive icon.
 Fixes on Vortigern By rotating the point and find new forward vector, it seems to work out well. However as noted, if you want to use more than 9 projectiles, you have to use other units such as thinker or dummy to store the projectile instead, but shouldn't be much more work if it's really necessary.
