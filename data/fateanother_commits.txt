Updated Saber Alter to show Mana Catalyst's counterThis update is for the user to be able to see the exact stack of ManaCatalyst he/she has before actually spending it. It is shown viaDerange's passive icon.
Fixes on VortigernBy rotating the point and find new forward vector, it seems to work outwell. However as noted, if you want to use more than 9 projectiles, youhave to use other units such as thinker or dummy to store the projectileinstead, but shouldn't be much more work if it's really necessary.
