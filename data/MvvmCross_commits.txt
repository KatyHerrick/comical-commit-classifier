 At Fragment host registrator: MvxFragmentAttributes are stored in List<> now - there is no need for a SortedSet as MvxFragmentAttributes are stored in list in same order they have been applied to Fragment class.
 Fixed bugs with MultiParent - Multi Parent Activity fragment feature works as expected now.
 Removed MvxListFragment - it is not implemented. DO we really have to support old ListFragment in RecyclerView era?
 Merge remote-tracking branch 'upstream/4.0' into 4.0
 Implemented Multi Fragment Activity Parent for Full Fragging and Shared Fragment code. MvxFragment is MultiCast Attribute now. The first MvxFragment attribute is the default MvxFragment attribute considered during presenter phase. So if actual activity host is invalid - the top one (first one) MvxFragment attribute is used by MvxFragmentPresenter.

 Merge branch '4.0' of github.com:MvvmCross/MvvmCross into 4.0
 It is now possible to cache different instances of ViewModel with IMvxMultipleViewModelCache by passing "viewmodel tag". Main reason why it was implemented: caching fragments was not possible if activity had multiple instances of same fragment type - cause ViewModel cache worked only for one of those instances.
 MvxMultipleViewModelCache is supposed to be thread-safe - but "CurrentViewModels" creation wasn't thread safe.

 Pass the java handle down to the base constructor to avoid a potentially nasty leak I haven't seen this in the wild but it should prevent a disconnect between the java and c# if instantiating the activity from java. I don't *think* we'd hit this unless starting an activity from an intent on the java side of things and we happened to override a virtual method called from one of the constructors.

 Missing changes to GetPositions from previous commit
 Improved MvxExpandableListAdapter implementation - Removed redundant SetItemsSource override which had a strong event subscription (and subscribed twice as the base method was also called). - Removed `as` casts causing confusing error (#1061). - Used existing methods from MvxAdapter where possible, thereby removing the need for a local reference to items source. - Reused GetRaw___ methods instead of duplicating code. - Prevented multiple enumerations (eg. `(this.GetRawGroup(groupPosition) as IEnumerable).Cast<object>().ToList()`).

 Fix for https://github.com/MvvmCross/MvvmCross/issues/1050. It solved my particular problem but am not sure about all possible consequences of FileShare.ReadWrite so please review carefully. Notice that typical System.IO.File implementation uses the combination of FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read, FileShare.Read and this modification uses the combination of FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read, FileShare.ReadWrite - file access is still Read-only but the sharing changes...

 Merge pull request #993 from jonstoneman/3.5-wpasyncfilestore FileStore is async with CancellationToken support on all platforms
 Introduce new layout inflation scheme Previously we would set a custom factory on the context's LayoutInflater that would catch all inflation requests. This prevented other Factories from getting a chance to run. For example AppCompat wouldn't get a chance to inflate custom views. This change introduces our own MvxLayoutInflater that wraps all the possible entry-points (via custom Factory implementations) delegating to any set factories and allowing us to bind after any custom factories have finished.
 IMvxLayoutInflater really holds onto a LayoutInflater. Rename to make the intention clear. This distinction will be important in the next commit.

 Experimenting with XamMac.Unified sample
 I made changes to MvxTouchSetup and MvxTouchDialogSetup to take a new interface, IMvxApplicationDelegate instead of the concrete MvxApplicationDelegate class. This allows Mvx to be used with other frameworks that have their own ApplicationDelegate that must be used such as Xamarin Forms 1.3.X+. Users of Mvx and Xamarin Forms can now create their own application delegate that inherits from FormsApplicationDelegate and pass it to MvxTouchSetup as long as their custom application delegate also implements the IMvxApplicationDelegate interface.

 Fixed FolderExists in FileStore for WindowsStore The previous implementation tried to get parent folder and see if the folder asked for exists within that... If the folder passed in as FolderPath was the LocalStorage folder, then parent will become the root which the application does not have access to and throw errors. Another workaround would be to give the app access to the root folder, but that seems to be not the best way to go about it.

 Empty files xml section in mvvmcross nuspec - stops all content files from being included!

 Initial large commit for Tibet Binding
 dialoglistview focus problems also solved
 More problems with viewtypecount (when adding elements dynamically) -> finally found that returning Adapter.IgnoreItemViewType does the trick
 W000000t finally solved the focus problems with multiple edittexts in a listview!! thanks to http://stackoverflow.com/a/15621096/336130 with some modifications
 Added linear layouts (can be used instead of listviews)
 ItemViewTypes were necessary using a listview after all

 Additional numeric tests - and a fix for double/int conversion
 tests for type conversion
 tests for type conversion
 Changes and tests to address #297 fallbackvalue issues
 Check if properties are really new values, prevents losing focus for a few ms while typing (and thus keyboard does not do auto-complete for example)
 Fixed event bubbling + added new event when the elements are modified runtime. Also, modifying the elements at runtime caused this :http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2596547/arrayindexoutofboundsexception-with-custom-android-adapter-for-multiple-views-in Removing ViewTypeCount and GetItemViewType from DialogAdapter.cs fixed it, but don't exactly know the consequences
 Made precision configurable and the event methods overrideable
 Made it a little safer. Some strange stuff is happening if you create your own layout for a dialogactivity, but this does fix that
 Revert "Inherit DialogAdapter from MvxAdapterWithChangedEvent/MvxAdapter so events are attached and views are bindable" This reverts commit be5b461d646cc11a5d73b887444928949b45f377. Did not really need it anyway in the end :-)
 reuse created views: If you have a ListActivity with a custom layout (SetContentView in oncreate), the views are requested again. The first created view should then be returned, otherwise there are 2 views somewhere (and you only see the first one). The events for binding etc. are connected to the last one, so changes do not appear in the list. This simple line fixes that headache
 Inherit DialogAdapter from MvxAdapterWithChangedEvent/MvxAdapter so events are attached and views are bindable

 Named Notify Property changed added - not convinced of the value of this - but fixes #245
 Update to enable auto-elements for properties not inheriting from object. Eg, if a property was : public int MyInt {get; set} Expression<Func<object>> will result in an expression with body set to UnaryExpression because of boxing the int to an object. This caused new EntryAuto(bindingExpression: () => MyInt, caption: "MyInt") to fail

 Bringing spinner into line with latest IMvxAdapter changes
 Lots of changes to MvxAdapter - switched usage to IMvxAdapter in the list, grid, linearlayout, relativelayout, etc - provided more inheritance permutations for linearlayout, relativelayout, etc - provided more virtual methods inside the MvxAdapter (not sure these should be used but...) - created IMvxAdapterWithChangedEvent to mirror IMvxAdapter changes

 Merge pull request #65 from dsplaisted/vnext Basic NuSpec file for MvvmCross
 Basic NuSpec file for MvvmCross. Installing this package in a project targeting MonoAndroid will not work until NuGet 2.3. This also applies to a PCL when you have added the MonoAndroid XML file to its SupportedFrameworks directory. A workaround for either of these issues is to install the package in a project type that is supported (Windows Phone or Windows 8 for example), and then to reference the DLLs in the solution's package folder from the MonoAndroid or PCL project.
