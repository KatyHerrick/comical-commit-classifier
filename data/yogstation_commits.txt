 Buffs Floroacid and cyanide to not suck balls Floroacid got nerfed from being ridiculously OP to basically the equivilent of having a lemon thrown at you. Floroacid is now potent, but not extremely lethal like it once was, so that it's still a credible threat, but not as obnoxious as acid spraybottles once were station killers. Cyanide is now not complete horseshit for all the difficulty it takes to make, and will probably kill people in less than four fucking hours.
 So 'bout them greytides.

 The deployable barrier now can report damage to the security channel! Start by inserting a security encryption key into it. You can also add a signaling device to it, in case you want it to report it's location as well. It also sends a final message when connected the security channel upon detonation. The keys/signaling device can be ejected with a screwdriver, but that cannot be done while it is locked/anchored. A signaling device now spawns within the security office.

 Merge pull request #630 from MrStonedOne/patch-1 Fixes ssair trying to proc unsimulated turfs.
 remove_from_active now handles unsimulated turfs properly (because if they are in the active turf list, they should get removed!)
 Fixes ssair trying to proc unsimulated turfs. An active/excited simulated turf would get deleted and converted to space, so this would change the turf in ssair's active_turfs list to a space turf, then it would runtime trying to call process_cell on it. (why byond!) Before a : and some lack of caring and a type check handled this. I removed this thinking it wasn't needed when i did my lag fix. (My exact thought was "why would an unsimulated turf get in ssair's active turf list, that seems like a bug that shouldn't get hidden" i forgot that deleting a turf just converts it to a space turf and all existing references are updated by byond to point to the new space turf) this OOP way seems better anyways.

 Merge pull request #308 from Cruix/Lube_Color Space Lube Nerf 1
 Adds tactical dolphin *available to nukeops for 20TC, with the same spawning process as syndicate cyborg. *can fly around space with no problems like any other dolphin. *like all simple mobs, it is immune to most stuns. *100 health, 15 melee damage. *heals 5 health from each bite of a syndicake, comes with 5 syndicakes. *has an unremovable syndicate headset. *comes wearing a removable harness. While wearing the harness, the dolphin has: *toggleable emag and night vision. *inventory the size of a backpack. The dolphin cannot put items in it, but any human can through the strip menu. The only way to remove items are to have the dolphin drop them, or remove the harness, which takes a human 6 seconds. *laser that shoots swarmer speed (once every 3 life ticks) and never runs out of charge. It has support for multiple weapons it can cycle through, but there is only the one installed by default.

 Merge pull request #326 from Cruix/fix_cyborg_ui Fixes Cyborg UI buttons
 Stolen alot of code from /tg/ made by ChangelingRain: - Blobs can block atmos: Strong blobs and core do that. - Blobs made more explosion resistant, core immune to bombs. - Split Consciousness requires a node under it. - Blob can expand on lattices. Small explosion optimizations, about 8-10% faster.
 If there is another active overmind with a core when your core is destroyed, you don't die. Go help out the other guy! You earn resources from Resource nodes normally and can build stuff. Can't Split/Relocate if you don't have a core.

 Made Wizard Shuttle a bit more shadowling friendly. Wizard shuttle now has a bunch of lights on it, instead of being full-bright. There's also a light switch near the magic mirror. Also some tweaks to shadowlings to make sure wizards can't get those goodies intentionally put out of reach. Basically makes a shadowling wizard a viable option.

 Shortened description.
 Drones now pass through doors with the added PASSDOOR flag as well as checks on Doors (Doors/Window Doors, but not firedoors and such). As a bonus, a certain unique corgi can now pass through doors as well. FUN.
 Golems can now have their Belt/ID/Pocket items removed.

 Let's not spam people with drenching messages.
 Changed carbon/clean_blood() to carbon/human/clean_blood() and moved it from carbon.dm to human.dm since it only did stuff for humans. Fixes showers not being processed correctly, especially for mobs. (processing will a bit more intensive unfortunately) Fixes showers not cleaning bloody human hands. Remove the now unused checkeyes() proc.
 Fixes Satchel preference not working. Also some simplification of the equip_backpack() proc.
 Fixes cable coil being dropped when trying to put it in a machine frame.
 haha wow totally forgot a tab
 Buffs the Bioterror Chem Sprayer The Bioterror Chem Sprayer is a fun idea on paper, but the reagents in it are kinda shit. It's one of the least bought items because it's pretty useless. It now has the following reagents: Sodium Thiopental, for stamina and knockout Coniine, for Toxin and Oxygen Venom, for scaling Toxin, Brute, and Histamine Decay Condensed Capsaicin, for an instant stun on application Initropidril, for the heart attacks Polonium, for the severe radiation All in all, this should make the Bioterror sprayer actually worth the points investment, and make it more fun to use as an operative.
 Fixes not being able to pour from a glass into a beaker when holding both in your hands.
 Fixes turfs updating their atmos overlay every atmos tick (I forgot a line) Also makes turfs only remove the current atmos overlay, not all of them. (I had tried this before, but it didn't work, and that turns out to be because of the line I forgot)

 More Dynamic wait tweaks. I forgot a step in the algo and made it so it was decreasing in its slowdown effect with more lag, not increasing.

 Fixes teleport-swap
 Due to recent shortages, justice helmets are more expensive Space Justice Warriors have been attacking freighters carrying the Justice Helmets, and they have been in low supply recently, resulting in an increase of price for justice enforcer cfates. Reports from captured SJWs claim that the helmets offend them. Requests to ban the sale of justice helmets will be met with equally insulting responses. - Nanotrasen Cargo Committee
 Fixes The clogged vent event making smoke spawn on welded scrubbers. Removes the problematic preference option to spawn without backpack (just drop your backpack after you spawn).
 Blob vortex shouldn't throw /obj/effect
 iron foam is now blue steel color just like aluminium foam. Fixes metal foam from backpack firefighter watertank. Fixes nanofrost not freezing shut vent scrubbers. Atmos backpack watertank now starts full of water. Change foam layer to Objlayer +0.1 so that it is above foammetalstructure so it doesn't hide the dissolving animation and also above tables. Buff foam and smoke: smoke/foam contains four times the amount of reagents that was inserted in them, for balancing. Add a little more smoke clouds for tear gas grenade. Removed the no longer needed max_lifetime smoke var. Reagent_dispensers (watertank) now show how much reagents they have left upon examination. Fixed some code formatting in reagent_dispensers. Fixes nanofrost temperature lowering effect that wasn't working. Adjusted reagent volume in blob spore smoke because of the buff. Change to sorium and ldm: effect varies with created volume. If you are close to a powerful vortex you are thrown, otherwise you are just moved instead. Vortex blobs now only make you step if you are far from it when reaction hits, otherwise it throws you. The vortex blob range gets +1 to compensate. Also the range and effect depends on the reagent volume which means lower effect for blobspore smoke.
 Fixed false walls incorrect icon update. Enabled mineral false walls.

Replaced all hard coded src.name/name for attack log's object argument with an actual object (src) except where it made more sense not to. All attack logging *should* happen AFTER damage is applied now. Removed the confusing attack entry for when a changeling stings another changeling. Tweaked how punch attack logs worked

 Transformed the datum into isolated procs.
 Transform Stings are no longer stealthy Because they're way too bullshit easy to make the station completely unable to function. When I originally made transform stings work on living targets it was never meant to be stealthy. They will however, give the target a very brief stun and jitter. The victim is basically being forced to transform as well, so the process will be slightly delayed but painful.

 Changelog and config updates
 Gang Update: Implants Edition - Multiple gang leaders are spawned at round start, the number which depends on server population - Only one boss per gang, the rest are lieutenants - Only the gang boss can recall the shuttle - Gangsters can no longer be promoted mid-game. - Security can once again deconvert gangsters with loyalty implants - A message is shown if the deconversion destroys the implant in the process - Added an Implant Breaker item to the gangtool as a purchasable item for 10 influence each - They are a one-use item that destroys all implants in the target, including loyalty implants - They will also attempt to recruit the target before destroying itself - As this is an implanter it requires the target to remain still for a few seconds to administer it - Implanters no longer work if the target is wearing headgear. Remove them first - Added help text whenever you buy certain items from the gangtool - Spare gangtools now cost 30 influence for everyone - They no longer give you a free pen - Increases domination limit back to 3 - Purchased outfits are automatically equipped in your hand, if possible - Gang boss has a 3 minute window at round start to select an outfit style. If he doesn't select one, the his lieutenants may pick one. No gang outfits can be created without a style picked first. - This is just to give the gang boss the first opportunity to pick an outfit style for his gang - You can now see how many outfits your gangtool has in stock - Outfits are no longer used up if you cancel the style selection prompt - Loyalty implant destruction message has been moved to its Destroy()

 -Adds new proc-based job check for species. If enforce_human_authority is set, the various pieces of code that deal with roundstart job stuff will call this proc on your preferred species with 2 arguments: the name of the job and the list of mutantparts you have currently set. -The proc is defined as proc/qualifies_for_rank(var/rank, var/list/features), and by default defined to always return 1. You must override it locally in your species definition to set special job properties. -Lizards will fail the check for jobs in command_positions and pass it for any other job. Just like before. -Humans will always pass the check if they don't have ears or tails. If they do have ears or tails, they will fail the check if the job is in command_positions, engineering_positions, science_positions, medical_positions, security_positions or equal to "Quartermaster", effectively limiting their job selection to civlian, lower supply and silicon jobs.

 -Added two new types of mutant accessories for humans: tail_human and ears. These ears are considered mutant parts and don't override normal human ears. -Added one ear and one tail accessory to these categories, obtained from the kitty ears. The ears are obviously cat ears, but the tail can pass for a monkey tail without ears. -Humans can now also edit alien/mutant colours. They have access to the full range of colours, but if the player switches back to lizard and the colour is too dark, it'll be reset to the default. -Renamed the original tail to tail_lizard. All references are properly updated and nothing has to be changed. -Could not solve an annoying bug with the setup window, where a lizard tail is rendered whenever a human tail is set. This problem only exists in the setup window and does not affect the sprite in-game.

 Rainbow slimes finally added to practical play. To get one you have to raise slimes through select breeding to 100 mutation chance. Even if you're blessed with RNG This will take a minimum of 14 generations of slime. Red slime can help speed this a bit, but then you're trading plasma for time. From the default mutation chance you'd have to drop 6 of these potions. Rainbow slimes only split into more rainbow slimes. Rainbow slime cores spawn a random colored slime on use, the practical use is to allow xenobiologists to slime paths they didn't breed for initially if they practiced good slime eugenics. You're still at the utter mercy of RNG though. Mostly a bragging rights reward.

 a few fixes
 Lots of work on acids, smoke, foam, reagents reaction() proc. - fixed the fraction argument in reaction(...., INGESTED, fraction) so the proper amounts of each reagent react, not all of it. - slight optimization of datum/reagents/reaction() - small optimization /datum/reagent/proc/reaction_mob - the smoke's reagents no longer do direct transfer upon crossed()/move() but uses "reagents.reaction( mob, TOUCH)" only. - fixes no ingesting smoke if it's in the dark. - removed block gas smoke effect flag from clown mask and other non "actual" gas mask. - refactor how protection against touched chems being absorbed is done. get_permeability_protection() to get that protection. No more simple RNG get touched or not, now the amount that touches you depends on your protection and the volume in question. - changes acid_act to take volume into account. - chem_smoke now uses process() just like foam, we remove the reaction from crossed() and Move(), it's only done in process() now. - optimization of effect/smoke, OOP! And now all smoke effects use objprocessing instead of shitty sleep/spawn - removed mob var/coughedtime. - add a volume check to item/acid_act(), there's a threshold to be able to melt and then a probability to melt (acidpwr&volume). - greatly lowered the amount of reagent in the smoke from dead blobspore (so the volume isn't enough for melting) - human/acid_act(): damage to limbs depends on acidpwr&volume. - fixes metalfoam not working. - smoke powder: only one start() call. - Amound of smoke objects depends on amount of smoke recipe created. - Adds an argument to add_reagent() to block automatic call of handle_reaction() - When using reagents/proc/trans_to(), reactions are now only handled after every reagent is transfered and not before. - Amount of smoke objects depends on amount of smoke reagent created. - radius of foam reaction depends on amount of foam reagent created. - The amount of other reagents inside the smoke/foam decides the life expectancy of the effect. - The amount of reagents in each small smoke cloud/foam cell depends on the amount of other reagents in the initial reaction but also how much smoke/foam was created (more smoke means dilution of the reagents). - smoke/foam's reagent reaction on mob decreases the life expectancy of the effect (to avoid reagent duplication) - The amount of reagent reacting with atoms is less if the life expectancy is high.(to avoid reagent duplication) - The amount of movement from the smoke now depends on the number of smoke clouds created. - removing some useless code in chem_grenade/prime(). - When calling human/acid_act(), item acid melting chance lowers after each each successful melt in the list, some of the acid is "used" to melt that item so the next items have a lower chance to melt (to make melting every clothing harder). - remove the banned reagent list from sprays, not needed anymore now that acid is nerfed. - chem_grenade reaction, if there's no reagent left after reaction (smoke/foam/etc, reagents cleared) you don't get the steam effect and immediate reaction with all atoms around the grenade explosion. (Fixes foam cleaner grenade deleting bloodstains around it as soon as the grenade explodes, even if the foam hasn't reached the tile yet). - melted storage items now drop their content instead of deleting everything.

 Request Console Radio Notifications So now that machines can talk on radio, we can make it so players can send messages on department radios without compromising their security. This also means you'll have a better alternative of trying to speak over everyone else in general radio. - Request Console message sent to major departments will now be broadcasted on that department's radio. Major departments include: - Bridge - Security - Medbay - Engineering - Science - Cargo Bay / Mining (Supply) - You can now call for emergency assistance with just one click from request consoles, which will either radio security, medical, or engineering. - This function has a 5 minute cooldown between uses during which the RC it was triggered from will flash red showing where it was triggered from - RCs don't automatically print papers any more

 - Fixed a bug where announcements were being made for destroying dominators that haven't been turned on - Added a changelog
 Loyalty Implants and Gang Mode Security treating gangs like revs has had a very negative impact on the experience of gang rounds. With an easy and convenient deconversion method, gangs are easily stomped as they rapidly run out of members to convert. So I'm going to try something different and see how things go if implants in gang mode acted as they are in cult. - Implants can still prevent conversion, but can no longer deconvert or identify gangsters - If a recruitment pen fails, the error message the gang boss receives will distinct loyalty implanted individuals from enemy gangsters.

 Changelog
 Department Management Console Originally conceived to manage budgets that can be used to buy things from cargo without their approval. But now it's just a limited ID console, but available in every Command Staffer's office. - Can only modify access to their own department, regardless of what ID is used to log in - Any department head can use these to promote/demote those in their department, including those who have access that you clearly do not remember authorizing - Can be modified to change the access of other departments by using a multitool on the circuit board.
 Some more tweaks: * Camera alarms now trigger on brute-force disabling. * The AI is no longer spammed when tracking people outside range.

 Cleans up Purple Whirl ghost sprite This was like, really obvious.
 Generalizes lizard parts to "features" for future non-lizard fields, at the same time merging mutant color into this list Random lizard bodies will finally have color! Pushes features almost all the way to the DNA side of thing, the mob side is only needed during character creation. Note that changes to the save file will invoke a one time per character runtime for legacy characters as the save file purges mutant_color, this is as far as I can tell harmless, has no effect on the player, and is self correcting.
 Put the AI's static on top of lighting again Fixes #9884 Lights are layer 15, for reference. I think they used to be 12.

 Tweaks MC's dynamic rate system a bit The MC will now track the total cost of all subsytems (normalized out to a per second cost number so that subsystems that only run every 10 minutes but are costly (looking at you server tasks) aren't accounting for 90% of the number when they shouldn't.) This is now used in the dynamic wait subsystems to ensure they slow down when other things are being lagging This mainly means that air won't lag things if the singulo gets free. I also tweaked the scaling curve used by the dynamic wait system so that it scales less during slight lag, but much more during higher lag times. I added qdel to the dynamic wait subsystem with a really high scale. This didn't make sense before, because it limits its run time, but now it can scale back how often it runs when the other subsystems are being laggy. I also lowered qdel's max runtime from 2ds to 1ds, because deletes take 0.9 ds on avg, so it would end up running for 2.9ds often. This should prevent air+singulo+qdel causing excessive amounts of lag.
 code improvement and overlays for fancy storage, dropper, syringe and lighter
 Oh my god I'm so tired and also I don't squash commits
 it's 3:45 am and I forgot to check the changelog
 Adds the bind soul spell for wizards. It turns them into a lich (skeleton) and gives them access to a long cooldown ressurection spell (starts at 3 minutes). The ressurection spell can only be used while dead/dying and charges at all times. When used the lich gains a new body at the site of their phylactery and is stunned for a short while. Meanwhile the old wizard body crumbles to dust leaving all the wizards worldly possessions on the ground. Anyone who sees the corpse crumble will also get a cardinal direction pointing towards the wizard. Every time the wizard dies this way, the time between ressurections is increased by a minute. To take a lich out of the game for good, either destroy the body before the lich can cast the spell again, or destory the phylactery and kill the wizard one last time. Liches spawn with robes and spells intact, but nothing else, everything collected on their original body stays there. As a balance issue, this spell can't be used in the den, the item must be bound after arriving at the station. Adds a nice black wizard robe ensemble for liches. Magic mirrors (save for a special badmin only one) can no longer skeletonize people. Adds a hopeful mulligan fix to wizard rounds problems. Also corrects an adminlog message.
 Fixes some bugs with fastmos. Fixes meters and air sensors processing after getting qdeleted, causing runtimes and preventing their GC'ing Fixes meters preventing the pipes they were attached to from getting GC'ed if both were deleted in the same action. Fixes z-vents not processing (we don't even use this, so it didn't matter)
 Adds feedback gathering for a hell of a lot more things.

 Fixed hacking from inside machines and more.
 Armor rune updated to allow multiple choices based on what you are wearing or holding. Adds FUN. Some nerfed versions of wizard spells can be used by the cult in exchange for unique clothing, these spells require the cult robes or armor in order to use. No armor choices are mandatory you will always have the option of the default choice if all you want is the sword and armor/etc. They are just extra choices for FUN. "Zealot": Default armor rune. If none of the required clothing is worn this will be chosen automatically. Is the same as ever. "Summoner": If you are wearing the wizard robe and hat when using the armor rune this choice will be available. User will receive magus robes and hat and nerfed versions of the summon shard and summon shell spells. "Traveler": Available to people wearing EVA suit and helmet. Replaces the EVA suit and helmet with the cult space suit and space helmet. Gives you a sword. "Marauder": Available to people wearing the captain's space suit and helmet. Same as Traveler except user is given a spell of summon creature (two creatures). They can and will attack the user. "Trickster": Available if wearing the RD's reactive teleport armor. Gives you magus robes, a wand of doors, and a nerfed version of Blink. "Physician": Available if wearing the CMO's labcoat. Gives you a wand of death and wand of life. Represents the CMO's ability to grant or take life, as a doctor. All of the wands can easily be lost to non-cultists and have the normal limited charges. (Wand of death and life only have 2 and 4 charges respectively.) All spells require the cult robes or space suit, normal armor will not work for casting them. Like I said, can easily be updated to allow more clothing or items to give the user certain things. I was thinking things like hand teleporter in exchange for teleport spell. That kind of thing. The possibilities are endless.
 Makes the experimental welder only regen fuel while off.

 Merge pull request #9658 from spasticVerbalizer/bloodDripsAreNotSpecial Stops humans from dripping blood while in lockers/bodybags
 Lowers Armor Values At some point someone changed the armor system to always block, which I understand, because RNG is annoying, but they didn't lower the armor values to compensate. Right now a basic security officer blocks 50% of all melee damage. It would take 7 hits from an esword/punches from a Juggernaut to reliably down an officer, and just a single stun baton to down a guy with an esword. It takes 20 hits from an inactive baton to crit a basic officer, 8 hits from an arblade, etc. In short, melee is completely awful as soon as someone throws on a basic vest. It makes melee weapons impossible to balance because even if they're strong enough to crit a random med doctor in 4 hits they're limp noodles vs a helmet. We can't move away from "I stun you lose" combat if stun weapons are 8-20 times as effective as anything else. I lowered the values around half for melee and tweaked laser resist a bit as well (again, it shouldn't take 10 lasers to down someone vs their one taser). I'm not overly attached to these values, nor are they particularly deeply thought about, I just wanted to get a conversation on git started where everyone would see it.
 Wizard Sounds has the update. Been a bit since i've done a commit, so forgive me if i did this wrong. Also added the third title song, there a lot of agreement on what to do so i'll just add it as is, if a change needs to be made i'll do it later.
 Cleaning up turf code Changes colons and spaces I forgot you could do this on github
 Changes how destroying turfs works Turfs now have a baseturf var which determines what is "under" every turf. The default is space. Actions that previously did changeturf(/turf/space) (like bombs or RCD deconstruction) now do changeturf(baseturf). Functionally the same for the station, but allows special turf types that don't break to space (such as planet tiles). Right now the asteroid tiles are the only thing with a baseturf other than space (the baseturf is an asteroid tile). Baseturf is tracked when new things are built, so building a floor and then a wall on the asteroid tile, and then bombing that wall will return it to an asteroid tile, not space. Allows building on asteroid tiles now that doing so wont randomly make holes to space. Time for giant mining forts. I should have done this years ago for away missions. Also added myself to admins.txt
 Antags with escape alone can win jointly with other antagonists, it only matters that normies are kept off. Non-antagonists can be brought on a shuttle without endangering an escape alone victory provided they're kept locked in the brig. Escaping to syndicate space abord the nuke op shuttle is now a valid way to escape in terms of objectives.

 Utterly guts the use of .locs from the game. They This means that multi-tile things may not handle correctly, but the only thing that used it was atmos for double wide doors, and they are used in one location that is unlikely to have atmos changes see: http://www.byond.com/forum/?post=1852790 for justifcation. (tl;dr: accessing .locs causes memory leaks)
 Minor workaround for the runtime in get_turf on world new. Adding this second check for turf_candidate being null FOR SOME FUCKING REASON is needed.
 Fixes an edge case in malf where mulligan could incorrectly determine that there were never any antags because the malf AI died by gibbing Resolves a similar sort of deal in monkey Note to self: if a mode has a hard return in the child before ..() you NEED to be sure continuous_sanity_checked is handled in the child. Note to future self: remove all hard returns in child modes, they are shit and cause all the mulligan bugs

 Removes the rare gibbing mechanic from blood boil because it can accidentally fuck over a cult by RNG gibbing a target (which doesn't count as a proper sac).

The new system will use the bitflag atmos_adjacent_turfs to reach for adjacent turfs and CanPass(). Fixes #436
 Added a check so mechs aren't able to drill space.
 Moved #9521 stuff here by Miauw's permission, so dead bodies' genetics cannot be altered anymore.
 Added spaces to percentages.
 Added a gap between Unique Identifier and Structural Enzymes -blocks. Made accuracy status show inside the table. Made Radiation Emitter Status align to left. Altered popup window size to fit nicely. Fixes #9076

 Merge pull request #9531 from Iamgoofball/patch-66 One day while Remie was coding, Pomf got fluffed.
 One day while Andy was masturbating, Woody got wood. He could no longer help himself! He watched as Andy stroked his juicy kawaii cock. He approached Andy which startled him and make him pee everywhere on the floor and on Woody too. Being drenched in his urine made him harder than ever! Woody: "Andy Senpai! I'm alive and I want to be INSIDE OF YOU." Andy: "Oh Woody Chan! I always knew you were alive! I want to stuff you up my kawaii ass!" Woody grabbed a bunch of flavored lube and rubbed it all over his head Woody: "Oh my! It's cherry flavored lube! Cherry is my favorite! Woody then stuffed his head up into Andy's tight ass! The other toys around the room watched intently as Woody shoved his head back and forth into Andy's nice ass, continuously making a squishy wet noise. The other toys also became aroused and they all gathered around Woody and Andy and started to urinate all over them, and then they started to masturbate. Andy: "Oh my goodness, Woody Chan! You are churning my insides up so well! Your nose is stimulating my prostate! OH YES! All the other toys became so aroused by this, that they could not help themselves anymore! They pushed Woody completely inside, and they all went inside. All of them wanted to be inside Andy's nice round ass. Andy: "No wait guys! My ass cannot hold this much! I'm getting so full! All the toys went inside of poor squirming Andy and pretty much, he was beyond full, and died from having his insides completely damaged. The mother came inside and found Andy, dead with a huge ass hemorrhage on his anus, with a HUGE belly full of toys. One day while Andy was masturbating, Woody got wood.

 Bugfixes
 This fixes the issue of colored jumpsuits not being dyeable into rainbow jumpsuits.
 Revampes airlocks normal controllers (virology and incinerator doors at the current map) The old controller and access buttons are replaced by: -/obj/machinery/doorButtons/airlock_controller -/obj/machinery/doorButtons/access_button Hopefully the path doorButtons will be the base for the replacement of the airlock controllers who are left The new controllers do not use radios at all, they link the doors with simple variables Fixes issue #267 The new controllers will not correct the airlocks state (open/close) on their process, they will only do it when ordered by the user If any door is missing, the door left will act like a single door correctly Cases where the doors modify themselves of powers go out while the controller is activated are covered to stop it Added a new sprite for the access_button, to represent lack of power The controller and the access button will now have animations using old unused sprites. The old computer datum used by the old controller is removed Map changes to replace the paths in the incinerator and virology airlock controllers Added a bolt() and unbolt() procs for airlocks The controller will search for the airlocks on initialization instead of each time the button is activated

 Tangential THICKMATERIAL-related fixes -Monkey bites now respect THICKMATERIAL. Essential for monkey mode. -Fixes Combat Hypo for Nuke Ops (wtf were you thinking goofball??), important since their thick hardsuits prevent many other forms of healing. Now it'll be better at healing and very good at helping up ops who are in crit.
 Adds a Create Shadowling button
 Mild Necromantic Stone Rework Skeleton Thralls lose explicit antag status in favor of implicit "you can wreck shit if the guy who made you can" status, same as adamantium golems. Two reasons: 1. Ressurecting antags played fresh hell with mulligan chances on wizards 2. Every time the skeleton was reraised it'd get a new protection objective, meaning they could theoretically have dozens of the same objective The roman armor gimmick is now a surefire thing. The necromantic stone is moved from the normal summon magic pool to the special "only one of these spawned" pool due to what I believe are buffs. Buffs the "serve the guy who raised you!" messages from notice all the way to userdanger, because people were just offering to skeleton people for free antag status and cool swords and ignoring what they were acutally supposed to be doing.
 Slightly widens the check antagonist panel Makes the "(logged out)" flag on antagonists read "(ghost)" because that's what it's actually tracking Together these fix #9268 Also sneaks a bit of mulligan functionality in so admins can see what the time and life checks for the mulligan system are, and modify them midround if desired. Also shows and allows editing of the "on failure" behavior of mulligans, specifically if they default to instant round ending if the mulligan fails or if it just doesn't create antags.

 Fixes a very edgy case where if a server was running up against a hard or extreme population cap it could theoretically reject someone already selected to be an antagonist, which could lead to all sorts of oddities. Not a pressing issue on tgstation servers, as the hard and extreme pop caps exist at higher levels than either server pull on even the highest of traffic days (or they're just off) Note that this check isn't relevent for late join antagonists, they roll for antag after spawning on the station, you couldn't just mash the join button until you managed to roll for antag.

 E
 All modes now choose their antagonists before they choose jobs. A new mind attached list, restricted_roles, will keep incompatible jobs out of rotation. Players who would otherwise qualify to play as an implanted job will spawn as the most wanted not implanted job they qualify for if they are an onstation antagonist. If they don't qualify for any job in this way depending on preferences they will either spawn as an assistant or a random job (which also makes sure they don't end up in an incompatible job). Note this doesn't impact late join antagonists or mulligan antagonists. Roundstart only.

 beachball path fix
 reorganizing stray objs in /defines
 Caps station integrity to 100%
 This makes it so that if it area doesn't require power, it will not actually be powered.
 Fix
 Adds a missing victory condition for noncontinous nuke ops where the round ends because all the ops died but it was still counting it as a syndicate victory because the disk was still on the station.
 Change machine frames and girders deconstruction step They now use the screwdriver instead of the welding tool On top of that I added a check to ensure you can't disassemble the same girder more than once to farm materials
 Fixed smoking pipe messages. Fixed emptying empty pipes. Improved check.
 Dead and unconscious people now cannot eject cryo
 Modified a pipenet error string.
 Fixes 9326 - MULEbots now ignore non-damaging projectiles.
 Fixes #9222
 Changelog for #9331 Adds the changelog entry for PR #9331
 Prevents ghosts ejecting people from cryo The cryo eject verb now prevents any non mob/living from ejecting people from the tube.

 Mop span fix.
 Merge pull request #9285 from MrStonedOne/fuck Fixes bug preventing pipe construction.
 Loyalty Implants and Gangsters - Experiment: Loyalty implants will no longer survive deconverting a gangster. Security now needs to use two of them if they want the permanent effects: The first to deconvert them, and the second to make them loyal.
 Slime Mutation Changes +new reactions Slime mutation chance starts at a flat 27% Slime mutation chance is now hereditary, with the new baby slimes inheriting the mutation chance of the parent (with a variation of -5 to +5). This allows you to cultivate slimes that are more likely to mutate over time rather than praying to the RNG forever. Plasma no longer causes slimes to have a higher mutation chance, and epinephrine no longer lowers mutation chance. Red slime extract+plasma now gives a potion that increases mutation chace Blue slime extract+blood now gives a potion that lowers mutation chance. The numbers might need tweaking if this makes xenobio too fast, but right now it is often frustrating and slow. It is more reliable and faster to build a mech than breed slimes given the current mutation system.
 Fixes changelog - Also juices Oranges

 minor correction.
 Auto-refresh option for MULEs Fixes #4087
 Fixes centerX and centerY not being correctly centered, corrects sphere logic. why is it called sphereMagic? because as far as I'm concerned, it is magic, it was previously named centerZ but it actually was quite a ways off being the center of any spheres. Idk what it does, but It serves a vital part of building mathematically correct spheres.
 Bots Revamp - Viciously rips radio code from bots, replacing it with something better and faster! - Bot patrol logic redesigned, much faster. - Gives all bots Robotics access for easy patrol activation. - Bot navigation beacons are no longer radios. Instead, they are maintained in a global list. - Navbeacons can now be accessed by Roboticists, and they use a better UI. - PDA bot code rewritten. They no longer use radio objects at all! - Captain now has all-access! His cartridge now has everything except Mime and Clown functions. - There is now one button across all PDAs for accessing bots. Only bots you have access to control will show on the list. - Buffed the signaler cartridge! It may now be used to signal on all valid frequencies. - The AI's botcall interface now includes the bot's model, so it can always identify the type of bot it is controlling. PDAs have this as well. - Spilled my blood to begin Jordie's dark ritual.
 Made a better sprite.
 Grammar for special_role
 Made the deconversion notice more noticable to others
 Fixed a bug with admins being told it failed to create a response team if they spawned a centcom official or deathsquad

 powernet datums now manually clear references, subsystem/proc/postpone() now takes an optional "cycles" argument, for postponing more than 1 cycle, Explosions are less laggy!
 Lowers charge time
 Fixes an instance where a sanity check was being mistakenly failed because blobs have a different sort of standard for being "alive" or "dead" than other antags. This will fix a problem where blob rounds weren't properly mulliganing.
 Added ability for cyborgs to pick their cable coil color.
 Update pipe vision when moving from scrubbers-->vents or vice versa via atmos/pipe fuckery, Fixes pipe vision not updating on login()
 Cult update

 I think I'm done but I'm always wrong Removed secure/new() due to it's current uselessness Put all changes in the secure overlays inside the update icon Found a bug where EMP act would only unlock the crate instead of breaking it but would still apply the emag overlay I defaulted the fix to breaking the crate. Moved the variables from emag act and emp act upwards for compliance with the update_icon() checks.
 Gangsters forget gangster identities on deconversion Added a line instructing the player that his character does not remember the identities of his former gang.

 mulligan will no longer mulligan a round into the same mode. Because of how scaling works this would at best only create one or two additional antags. At worst it wouldn't create any antagonists, and mulligan would get frustrated and reroll after its failure.
 Batons for Light ERT Moved the batons from the lockers to their backpacks so light ERTs can use them
 Moved the overlays.cut() per request.

 Let's make the message slightly less gamey
 Rolls back the message for a round that starts noncontinuous with no antags since this theoretically could happen if a station is full of antag hating peaceniks with no flags set. Disables mulliganing into DA since it's currently borked and I need to look closer at it anyways
 Made plasma exhale as CO2 instead oxygen. 1: Oxygen is indirectly harmful to plasmamen (they ignite) 2: Burnmix outputs CO2
 Makes Simple Animal Clowns drop Human Clown corpses.

 Mop can now be wetted in the sink.
 New fire overlay sprite for ALL Humanoid mobs, Removes hacky plasmaman fire underlay code - Thanks WJohnston!
 Adds sanity checking for configuration settings (or lack there of) that create situations where a round would end immediately because no antags had ever existed. This closes a hole where server owners could experience highly interuptive roundtypes like non-continous extended because they didn't keep their config files up to date.
 Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/tgstation/-tg-station into mopbucket
 Not having a breathable gas is now equivalent (code+mechanically wise) to not having enough oxygen. Plasmamen now heal brute and burn damage from the plasma reagent.

 Massive MC and subsystem rewrite MC: No longer tracks a subsystem's cpu usage. This was basically worthless and took up space on the stat panel Can calculate wait down to a tenth of a decisecond to make it fps/world.ticklag agnostic Now allows subsystems to have a dynamic wait, that is based on a ratio of how long that subsystem has been taking to process(cost). (This system allows for upper and lower bounds, and an changeable cost delta for each subsystem) MC can now be told to init a zlevel All Subsystems: Stats panel now allows child subsystems to pass it a message to add to its stats entry. All subsystems have been moved over to this system - This should cut down on subsystems having to copy and paste the stats proc in order to add to it All subsystems now properlly handle being given a zlevel in their init proc Subsystem changes: Air: Added air to the dynamic wait subsystem. upper bound: 50, lower bound: 5, cost delta: 3 times process cost Air now fires 4 times faster when it can do so without lagging things up Pipenet has been merged into air Atmos machinery now processes with process_atmos(), ticked by air, not machinery. Hotspots (the fire object) are now object pooled Pipenet: Deleted, added to air Machinery: Moved all atmos calcualtions in all objects's process() to process_atmos(). Lighting: Added Lighting to the dynamic wait subsystem. upper bound: 20, lower bound: 5, cost delta: 3 times process cost Ticker: Fixed ticker not updating the lobby panel when game start delayed Fixed the game start timer updating rapidly from queued fires when game start delay is removed Garbage/qdel: qdel will now limit its process time to 2ds a fire. qdel can now be given hints as a return to Destroy() as to what should be done with the object. the options are: queue: (default) this is the normal behavior. letmelive: old default to non-null/zero. does nothing with the object iwillgc: functionally the same as above, mainly to let people working with objects know that the object will not be queued for GC checking harddel: this will queue the object to be deleted without storing a soft reference, mainly to save locate() processing time. harddel_now: this will del() the object. To allow for a clean removal of every del() not in qdel All objects have been updated to the new system, harddel and iwillgc was not added to any new objects. Fixed some objects not GCing because they didn't properlly clear references in Destory() Fixed some objects getting qdel'ed preventing other objects from getting GCed because they did not null their reference to that object.
 Admins can now adjust pre-game delay time Instead of just a simple Pause/Play toggle, it lets admins set a longer (or shorter) time if they want. Admins can still set -1 for indefinite delays.

 Removes particle cannon
 Doubles Initial SMES charge The station has expanded over the years with more and more rooms (and APCs) added that drain the SMES. Moving the emitters to drain the SMES instead of the APCs probably didn't help, either. Engineers don't get nearly as much time as they should these days, with a loose singularity appearing in the first 10 minutes a lot more common, through no fault of the engineers other than they weren't fast enough. I've seen the SMES drain approximately 8ish minutes since round start. This boosts it up to ~15 minutes.

 Removed unnecessary check
 Changelog
 - Capture goal reduced to 60% - You must be in the territory physically to tag it now. So no more tagging everything from maint. - Influence income changed to provide weaker gangs a bigger boost, while slowing down stronger gangs to promote opportunity for comebacks - Gangs only earn influence on territories they have held on to since the previous Status Report (the income calculation every 5 minutes). This places more significance on defending your existing territory. - Removed solars and shuttles, and the toxins test chamber from valid territory list - Victory conditions are only checked during Status Reports. - Bosses no longer receive territory updates real-time. They now get them all as a list of new and lost territories in the Status Update. - You cannot tag tiles with APCs. No cheating, you maint crawlers. - Goal is now a coeff var so it can be modified in-game for debugging/playtesting purposes - Simplified some list checks for gang - Trying to tag an invalid area will just error out and return, instead of the ganger spraying regular grafiti and confusing them

 Adds cultist prayer, removes sound from non-chaps
 Ports Nienhaus's guitar, the additional sounds are about ~1mb. Moves most of the code from violin up to instrument and makes violin a child of it. (Guitar is a child of it as well.) Fixes violins on Metastation and Box due to the repath, adds the guitar to both.
 Renames Violin.dm to Instruments.dm in preparation for generalizing the code and to preserve the git history.

 Changelog
 Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/tgstation/-tg-station into Carpops
 Dehydrated carps inherit factions (minus neutral) from their owner.
 Any roundtype can now take advantage of continuous/non-continuous settings as well as the mulligan antag system. (as a reminder at this point the mulligan system only creates lings and/or traitors) A generic check for antags now exists in check_finished, and overrides a lot of checks in specific modes. Specific checks are still needed if you have special means of determining antag viability (blob cores), or things to do when specific antags die (summon events). In situations where mulligans are on but fail, the round will usually lurch on as "extended" but in wizard/malf/blob/ragin mages the round will end then and there. This mirrors current behavior. Config settings are fully customizable and for the most part defaults mirror existing behaviors: Revolution, Shadowling, Gang, Ragin Mages and Monkey are noncontinuous and will end with the death of all antagonists. * There is a change here in shadowling in that rounds with living thralls but no living shadowlings will continue until the thralls are delt with, as they can still raise their dead master. * Abductors not ending with the death of all ayyliens if there are still probe victims around is likewise a change. If the dev of abduction would rather have it default the other way, we can do that. * Monkey being noncontinuous is a change, but given how monkey mode works, it really only makes sense. All modes that are continous use the mulligan system by default, remember that this will only come into effect if EVERY antagonist dies, so modes with many antagonists are very likely to only mulligan extremely rarely because if even one isn't slaughtered and is instead brigged or otherwise neutralized nonfatally the mulligan will never come. A nice little bonus for security not to kill everyone! Fixes a bug where shuttle stranding could occur in continous rev modes (not something on by default) Probably buggy as hell in initial commit. Please no quick merge

 Gang Update v3 The coding isn't done yet, but the design is. So comment on the design while I smooth out the code. tldr; Gang mode rewrite to follow my original vision: Slower and longer rounds with less deathmatching, and a resource both teams have to fight over NEW OBJECTIVE: CLAIM HALF THE STATION AS TERRITORY - Gang bosses can spawn special spray cans that can be used to tag areas - Any gang member can tag areas. - Gang tags must be removed before another one is placed in the same area - Game mode no longer automatically ends when the boss dies. It now ends when either the station evacs, or one gang claims more than 50% of the station areas - Boss can promote gangers into his lieutenants, which basically means adding more bosses - Lieutenants can do anything bosses can except promote others to lieutenant NEW RECRUITMENT TOOL: PENS - Recruitment pens replace flashes - Looks exactly like a pen. Stab people to recruit them. - Recruitment is silent but obvious to the perceptive (Causes a brief seizure) - Cooldown between uses that gets longer as the gang gets larger NEW TOOL: GANGTOOL - Replaces the recaller device. Can still recall the shuttle. - Provides overview information about the gang (membership size, income amount and time) - Can spawn pistols and ammo - Can spawn additional recruitment pens - Can spawn additional gangtools (For personal use, or promoting a single ganger to lieutenant) NEW CURRENCY SYSTEM: NAME IS WIP - Gangtools purchase items with new currency with the placeholder name "Supply Points (SP)" - Supply points are collected every 5 minutes. The more territory a gang has claimed, the more points they get. - Supply points are accumulated per-gang. Having more gangtools does not intrinsically give you more points to use.

Hallu kind of ruined the "surprise" so I decided not to use it. Weaken/stun/paralysis are also not in right now because I'm lazy. All the sprites are included even if they're unused.

Remove the "if(!M) M = holder.my_atom" at the beginning of a lot of on_mob_life procs, you already can't call on_mob_life if M is null (Chemistry-Holder.dm). Moved random_color_list to datum/reagent/colorful_reagent Nerfed healing power of stimulant. Buffed ephedrine a bit. Fixes some goon chem on_reaction() proc leaving resulting chem behind when they shouldn't. Removes Life, nitroglycerin and Corgium reagents. They're now only a chemical reaction. Moved grenade launcher and syringe gun from reagents module folder to gun folder. Added a message for the ghost when someone is trying to revive its corpse with strange reagent. (like defib) Fixes Frost oil and other consumable reagents using current_cycle var. Fixes runtime where during metabolization a reagent removes another then the latter still calls on_mob_life().
 Made a proc for mineral scanning.
 Fixes infinite rod via disposals duplication Fixes #9007 Sadly they still generate a set of rods but at least they only do it once.

 fixes a goof where if a blob round was continous but not using midround_antag the shuttle would get caught in a loop of repeatedly stranding and unstranding itself. emergencyNoEscape was being fixed in the mulligan code, and I forgot to generalize it out when it stopped being an assured thing that a continuous round was also a mulligan round. The other two potentially effected modes (Malf and Wizard) already had this check generalized.
 New Jobbans, and proper messages for when you fail to spawn antags.
 Stops blobs from getting ruined by stamina damage
 Removes admin notices on failed logins in isbanned This could be used to spam admins, without them having any way to stop it, and as tobba has informed me, isbanned() is called before byond does much validation on the data (like checking that the claimed username exist or validating that they own it), leaving these notices vulnerable to html injection
 if(state == 1) added to few places.

 Merge branch 'syndie_tweaks' into 'nextversion' Syndicate traitor item adjustments A bunch of small tweaks and one large rework aimed at traitor items/antagonist style gameplay in the wake of the new updates for traitor items. The major changes are: * Syndicate minibombs are no longer capable of gibbing corpses, because the minixbow/prone into minibomb over proned body strat immediately removed someone from the round 9/10 times with no opportunity for counterplay. Minibombs still pretty much kill a person who's caught in their radius, and their improved blast and flash radius plus lowered TC cost (to compensate for the loss of TD value) makes them useful tools for property destruction through walls and other more sneaky applications. Minixbow/prone into minibomb will still kill a person, but it will leave an opportunity for their corpse to be retrieved. * Sleepy pen's reagents changed from 30u morphine/10 tirizene/10 mutetoxin to 20u tirizene/10 mutetoxin. Morphine addiction took over 5+ minutes to take effect and gave the victim a debilitating, difficult to cure round-long affliction that pretty much ruins the rest of their round until they die. It also made sleepy pens not immediately effective. * Tirizene has been changed to be a rapid stamina depletion toxin, inducing unconsciousness upon player exertion (movement/combat) past a certain threshold. There is counterplay in this - a player who is affected by this that chooses to hold their ground and fight will deplete stamina much more slowly than they would if they were moving, so they have a chance to resist the traitor and potentially alert someone via the scuffle. If they run however, they will fall unconscious very quickly (within 5-10 seconds), and stay unconscious for a duration similar to the old sleepypen pre goonchem. There are checks to ensure that tirizene stacking is not effective past a certain peak, to prevent people from buying like four pens and incapacitating someone for 5+ minutes. * Riot foam darts have had their stamina damage nearly doubled to give them a real impact. 25 stamina damage is nothing considering 10 is regenerated per tick when standing still. Players were reporting that they could unload an entire clip into someone and not have them fall down for long enough to handcuff. This should address that, and make the item worth the TC. * Mime's nothing reagent decays into tiny amounts of mutetoxin. Very negligible (and random) effect, but I am sure someone will find a clever way to use it as a mime traitor/antag. See merge request !154

 Adds changelog for admin ghost drag
 Adds some sanity checks to admin ghost drag.
 Removes resting from ghost verb This caused issues with mobs like borgs and simple mobs where they would be unable to move if admins put another ckey in the mob after they ghosted but there would be no clear indication as to why they couldn't move and in some cases, no way to un-rest without further admin intervention.

 Admins can now drag ghosts to mobs to put that ghost in control of that mob. This functions the same way as editing the ckey in vv, and has the same permission checks It requires the admin also be a ghost to avoid conflicts with other drag drop code.

 Merge pull request #8581 from MrPerson/lighting_2015 Object based lighting system
 Moved lighting stuff from controllers folder to its own module Lighting SS no longer cares about the return of check(); the light datums are responsible for deleting themselves. Cap on lighting effects from turfs is now 8 because they're static and shouldn't be flashing lights too often. This means starlight actually works now instead of being capped at 1 measly turf. Lighting related ChangeTurf() code is in the lighting module. Changed it up to be faster on lighting controller init and not leave dangling lights when a turf becomes or stops being opaque or when it turns into space. This diff log is gonna be useless sadly but take my word for it, it all works. Lighting related Moved() code is also in the lighting module. Opaque objects will now update nearby lights when they move (mechs). Opaque objects other than the light datum's owner on the same tile as its owner will block the effect of the light. In other words a mech standing on the same square as a light bulb will block all the light of that bulb. Changed "cheap_hypoteneuse()" with an even cheaper version; actually calculating the hypoteneuse! I can prove it's cheaper if needed. Removed move_contents_to() because it's unused and trying to use it would cause major bugs with lights and other shit and I have no interest in supporting that, so let's not even tempt people.

 Removes spraycan equipping message and moves their priority down Spraycans are nice but non-essential in rev and gang. I'd like to remove the message they send to the user when equipped to keep the instructional text concise. I also moved their priority down so they are spawned and equipped last, just in case the mob doesn't have the room for all of the stuff.

 Organizes the various continuous_round_x config options into one set of config options continuous. Functionality is only there for the same mode that already had that functionality, everything else is continuous always Makes another set of config options for which rounds types, if any, use the midround antagonist (mulligan) system. Keep in mind this is by definition a subset of round with continuous set. Again this feature is only present for the roundtypes where I KNOW it works properly, other modes can't use midround antags. The check antagonist screen will show how the game will behave when all the antagonists die, and it can be changed on the fly by admins, the four possible states are: End on antagonist death (noncontinuous rounds) Continue if antagonists die (unsupported continuous by default round) Continue if antagonists die, creating replacement antagonists (continuous, using midround antags) Continue if antagonists die, not creating new antagonists (continuous, not using midround antags) When rounds prepare to mulligan admins will additionally get the option to just keep the round going without any automatically created antags in case they want to run their own shinanagans instead. They can also as before choose to end the round.

 Fixes Spraycans not coloring faces correctly * Changes Spraycans and lipstick to use a fully tintable overlay. * Lipstick now comes in more colors and (codewise) can be changed with one var. * Spraycans now color the face overlay correctly, racism for everyone!
 Nerfing plasma cutters, their damage and range is reduced in pressurised environment. Reduces drilling cost of all drills to make them appealing. Drill cells are now removed by clicking the drill, no more screwdriver needed. Resonator fields can no longer be stacked on each other. Switching from 5 to 3 seconds detonation on the resonator is now done by clicking it instead of screwdriving. Increasing building costs for plasma cutters. Removes mineral/screwdriver upgrades to resonator and kinetic accelerator. Plasma cutters can now only uses solid plasma.

 -Defibs no longer have a minimum damage requirement. Previously the body required to be damaged in order to be defibbed (Required to be damaged, atleast 200 units). I can only assume that this was the case because the author had math that needed the body to have atleast 200 units of damage for it to work correctly, but I assume that the author naively thought it was impossible to heal corpses. --Defibs now restore the health of the user to halfway between crit and death (-50 health or 150 sustained damage). If the user has little damage sustained, they will receive oxyloss to place them to the halfway point. If the corpse has more damage than the halfway point, they will be healed to the halfway point, in a ratio based on how much they sustained in each type of damage they took. --Defibs will not heal cloneloss, and will still damage/heal the patient to the halfway point including the cloneless (eg a patient who is 0/0/0/0 with 30 cloneless receives 120 oxyloss). If the patient has too much cloneloss, they will heal fully, except they will still have the cloneloss (eg, they will be 0/0/0/0 with 180 cloneloss on revival) --Additonal feedback given for some failure states for the defib.

 Adds three new blob chems: Omnizine blobs inject omnizine on hit, which initially HELPS mobs fighting it, but if they aren't careful in how often the blob hits them, they can rapidly fall into a very painful and hard to treat overdose. Three hits will inflict a heavy damage over time effect, more than that will inevitably cause death without treatment. They're a pleasent light lavender color. Morphine blobs inject morphine on hit, which will keep mobs from slowing down but eventually will make them fall asleep. One hit will force a very small sleep after a while of fighting, multiple hits will forces longer sleeping after the same delay and overdose mechanics that make people drop held items and do minor tox damage. They're gunmetal grey. Space Drugs will inject space drugs on hit, which makes mobs stumble around and make backing off from the blob more difficult. It also does minor on hit toxin damage. It's a weedy green. Adding more blob chems makes any one chem type rarer, so I feel like this is one of the more fun ways the strength of some blob chems can be mitigated.
 Nerfs the kinetic accelerator. Remove the plasma upgrade chance of rigging the cell since it doesn't work as intended and can break the KA without any feedback.

 Fixes goat not producing milk and not retaliating. Fixes bear not being able to attack you when it's AI is asleep and awaken by finding you as target. Fixes many hostile animals not having their own attack verb text or attack sound. Fixes goat moving even when pulled. GiveTarget() is now called by FindTarget (because it was always called after every instances of FindTarget, and this solves the lack of retaliation).
 WJohnston added invisible pixels near the opened airlocks so closing them won't require pixel-accurate clicking anymore, just clicking near the airlock (or the dents) is enough.
 "var oldloc"s -> "var/oldloc" Fixed the unsecured girder sliding below vents and scrubbers by placing it on layer 2.45.

 Fix can_speak check in megaphone The original check actually made no sense, but worked because it returned false every time as there was never a message passed through
 Give kudzu mouse_opacity 2 so clicking them is easier Clicking anywhere on a turf not occupied by something else == clicking the kudzu. Makes them much easier to click basically.
 Consistency with X_act() names, Ninjas can now electrocute carbon mobs by "draining" them, as they would a cell/smes/mecha etc.
 Removes SpiderOS, SpiderOS Information moved to a SpiderOS Statpanel, Fixes ninja_sword_recall() by preventing a katana from ever hitting its owner (it can still hit other ninjas)

 Juggernaut Balance Option 2: Removes the chemical effects from blobbernauts and buffs their brute damage Blobbernauts overall since the changes made to blob in Blob Mania have been received as overpowered. This is the second option to fix it, which makes them rely on their base brute damage to get kills. Since most people walk up to a blob expecting it's set reagent effects, this will serve to catch blob fighters off guard if they're expecting oxygen loss and get hit with brute.

 Proper UI for gun lockers
 Move time for lighting changes from a scale to a fixed length PDA's start off again, but the code is still there. forceMove() now calls Moved() and has some other minor tidying up. This means teleporting will update the lights around you right away.
 Object based lighting system Uses actual objects on each non-space, dynamically lit turf. Light levels are switched back and forth via animate() and the object's alpha. Supporting colors shouldn't be too hard. Some hacky efficiency improvements means it isn't that much more expensive than current (I think, needs testing). Most of the lighting ss's cost is in checking all the lights and doing big loops, not anything actually in the loops themselves. Start PDA flashlights on. This was to speed up testing but frankly I think it's a good change in general. Added a Moved() proc. Called after a successful move. In the future I hope to move off the luminosity var entirely but that was too slow in testing for me. That's what all that "for(area in sortedAreas) area.luminosity = 1" stuff in the lighting ss is, tests on removing luminosity outright.
 Remove an infinite loop in getFlatIcon It's unlikely that this could ever be triggered but it's worth doing Credit to report from https://github.com/ParadiseSS13/Paradise/issues/596

 Change holidays into datums Holidays are now actual datums with procs and vars and everything. Holidays run a proc called celebrate() when it's time to celebrate them. Currently none of them do anything but that should change, wink wink. Holidays can now run for more than a day. The important ones, april fools, christmas, halloween, new years, and easter, all last at least a week. The idea is so people can celebrate christmas in game without having to, you know, actually play on fucking christmas. And also to put a time limit on how long stuff like the annoying spookoween closet skeletons will stick around so it doesn't overstay its welcome and become annoying as shit like last year. The event SS now allows more than 1 holiday to run at a time. This matters for new years + christmas, easter + april fools, easter + 4/20, and any holiday that can happen on friday the 13th. The events get stored in a list that's only initialized if there's an active holiday so testing for potential holidays is still pretty easy. Added more easter dates so we won't have to add more until 2040. The current batch run out in 2017.

 Instrument tweaks The piano will stop playing once you walk away from it or get stunned. The song BPM of the piano and violin will generally speaking be wrong because of discrepancies between the sleep between notes and world.tick_lag. I've solved this by locking BPM to points where the stated BPM will actually be the case because tempo == world.tick_lag. Example Current: song @ 5 tempo - 120 BPM: c, c/2, c -> note -> sleep(5) -> 6 ticks (5.4 time passes) -> note -> sleep(2.5) -> 3 ticks (2.7 time passes) -> note. With this PR: song @ 5.4 tempo - 111 BPM: c, c/2, c -> note -> sleep(5.4) -> 6 ticks (5.4 time passes) -> note/2 -> sleep(2.7) -> 3 ticks (2.7 time passes) -> note. I was hoping this would make the damn things sound better but then I realized it wasn't actually messing anything up. Oh well.

 *Retires Departmental Uprising to the land of admin only access like its brother fake explosion before it *Changes the mechanics of recasting summon events to only reduce the upper limit of the time between event casts (-1 minute each additional cast) as opposed to touching the lower limit as well, which led to events every 15/30 seconds which, while certainly a scene, I admit was a bit much. Casting summon events 5, 6, or 7 times will now at worst result in an event every minute. *If a wizard round mulligans, summon events will turn off if it was used. Remember that in wizard mulligans any apprentices will need to be dead too.
 Added inbuilt jetpack to syndicate hardsuit.
 Changed anti-drop implant emp_act(). Added designs to mech fabricator.
 Cleaned up the functionality and prepared things for PR.
 Removed dangerous "hacked" foam darts, as they were a little more powerful than intended. Hopefully this is something I can fix at a later date. Fixed non-magazine ammo boxes not accepting their correct ammo type. Added a speed collection system to all ammo boxes. Finally balanced out the cargo ordering stuff.
 Glorious second commit, introducing (mildly) dangerous rounds and a new suicide check.

 Merge pull request #8379 from MrStonedOne/patch-3 fixes issue with admin preferences applying to non-admins
 fixes issue with admin preferences applying to non-admins fixes issue with admin preferences applying to non-admins. This is a preference that only admins can change, but if a users save file gets fucked, or a admin who turned it off gets de-admined. it still applies to them. I don't know why this even exists, it seems to have been around since google code, maybe even since goonleak, but it should be checking for admin before applying to peoples nonetheless.

Fixes using the spray at short range not showing the whole chemical puff animation. For a given max range of a spray, aiming closer will now transfer more chemicals to each mobs/objs/turfs than aiming the furthest.
 Fixes russian revolver's special mechanism message appearing when placing it on a table or in your inventory. Fixes its description about auto spinning barrel. Fixes its behavior when used as a melee weapon.
 Fixes burger and sandwich ingredient stacking and sprites.

 slight adjustments..
 Fixes steel cap bug. Steel cap now growns steel logs similar to wooden logs, you use the hatchet to get rods. Reorganizes all flashing to use the same mob proc 'flash_eyes()' (welding tool use, flashbang, flashers, laserpointers, etc). Fixes making sandstone not stacking the result sandstones on the floor. Sandstone, grass tile and carpet tile now look for other incomplete stack on their creation location to try to put them all in one stack (exactly like wood planks). Fix typos. Remove banglet var from all flashbangs, making flashbangs from clusters behave exactly like the other ones. Renames eyecheck()proc to check_eye_prot() and moves it to mob/living level, elso creates check_ear_prot() for checking ear protection.
 Reduces the taser firing delay.
 Laser slugs + improvised shell fix Adds laser slugs, fixes improvised slug recipe
 Pulling icon en-speedening Made the little pulling icon on the bottom right corner of your screen update right away when you start or stop pulling instead of updating as part of life(). Or Move().
 Ion shell updates Ion shell now acts as a shotgun of weaker ion bolts. Stronger than a regular ion rifle when fired point blank, but suffers at longer ranges.

 Removes the paths to get skeletons and zombies in normal play but also does not nerf them. They can still be found through a few very rare mutation chances (I think?) and wizbiz.
 Adding changelog
 Adds the ability for admins to "take the shot" and end rounds at their discretion. This is behind a two confirmation gate with a 20 second reflection period between them. All this is logged. When mulligan antag is set to kick in, the suggestion for admins to end the round if they feel enough has happened is given. The option can also be found on the check antagonist panel. The check antagonist panel will show what the muligan roundtype is if it exists. If absolutely no one wants/can be the midround antags, the round ends there. The round will end no matter what if the primary antagonist survived over an hour before biting it (unless the shuttle is already past the point of no return, in which case a peaceful ending takes priority) Adds force_ending to VV editing protection, to avoid admins trying to shinanigans it on.
 Improvised heating fix: Fixes dough recipe from egg + 15u flour beaker. Adds a limit to how hot the beaker reagents can be heated. (no hotter than the heat source) moving reagent_containers/attackby() to reagents/reagent_containers.dm for better visibility.

 Updating from the git web interface is a bad idea, you shouldn't do it!
 Allows admins (or coders if worn icons go the way of inhands) to specify an alternate file to load worn states from.
 Skeletons and zombies lose temperature immunity and radiation immunity, reducing how awesome they are in the face of their relative ease of access. They still don't breathe or have blood.

 Conversions and De-conversions briefly renders you unconscious Getting converted or de-converted from a rev, gangster, or cultist will knock you out for a few seconds. This is to stop them from running around, attacking people, yelling and gives them a brief moment to take in what just happened to them.

 Makes Gang mode functional again I'm going on vacation soon so I thought I might as well bring this game mode back up to at least a minimally functional state before I go. A lot of features (Gang membership visibility, conversion pens, weapons, deconversion methods) have been stripped out for now. I gave gang bosses uplinks in the meantime. It's basically rev vs rev right now, but the victory conditions with the recallers are still there. I'll work on adding more stuff after I return from my vacation.

 [Map] Shuffles Assistant Spawn Locations Moved them about so they spawn in public lounging locations, instead of random hallways, dorm rooms and maint closets which IMO should be kept clear so they don't get in the way if they're AFK.

 Preserve Objectives when admin-removing antag status Sometimes admins want to change someone's antag type or simply refresh their antag status to fix bugs, while still preserving their objectives. Being forced to lose them makes these really frustrating to do! Admins can still manually remove their objectives from the same window (Mind Window/Traitor Panel).

 Merge pull request #8051 from xxalpha/surgeon_ops Adds surgery table and tools to the Nuke Ops ship.
 On screen alert system Replaces some of the hardcoded HUD icons defined at mob level with a pair of mob procs throw_alert() and clear_alert(). Alerts will appear on the top-right side of the screen. You can shift-click alerts to get a description of what's wrong and sometimes a tip on how to solve the alert. Alerts can be given a master, which overlays the master on top of a box and forwards clicks of the alert to that master. Getting buckled will put an alert of what you're buckled to, for example. If it's a chair, you just click the alert and you're unbuckled. The idea I'm shooting for is to replace resist entirely with this kind of stuff. Making a new alert and using it is a little complicated. This explanation will suck, but this is simpler than I'm making it sound, I promise. Throw_alert() has 4 args, category, id, severity, and obj/new_master. If you don't supply an id, category will be used as id. Only 1 alert per category is allowed; any duplicate will be replaced. Additionally clear_alert() clears alerts by category. Id MUST match a type path of /obj/screen/alert/[id]. That type path is where the alert's name and desc come from. The icon_state of the alert will either be "template" if new_master is set or [id][severity] otherwise. new_master is totally optional. Examples: throw_alert("oxy") -- takes name/desc of obj/screen/alert/oxy, icon_state = "oxy" -- clear_alert("oxy") throw_alert("nutrition","fat") -- takes name/desc of obj/screen/alert/fat, icon_state = "fat" -- clear_alert("nutrition") throw_alert("nutrition","starving") -- takes name/desc of obj/screen/alert/starving, icon_state = "starving" -- clear_alert("nutrition") throw_alert("temp","cold",1) -- takes name/desc of obj/screen/alert/cold, icon_state = "cold1" -- clear_alert("temp") throw_alert("temp","cold",3) -- takes name/desc of obj/screen/alert/cold, icon_state = "cold3" -- clear_alert("temp") If you pass a new_master, id is only used to get name/desc and still must match a path, but the icon_state is "template" and icon is from the mob's ui preference instead of icons/mob/screen_alert.dmi. Several unused icons removed, like borg oxygen and temperature alerts. Also some icons were used but now are not and were removed, like the nutrition icon for being well-fed and cyborg charge icon for being fully charged.
 Removed new zippos. Changed color list.
 Adds a free pass to assistants for player accounts younger than two weeks.

 Changeling
 Adds the Coderbus and Adminbus bar signs
 Replaces the custom "how many people are dead?" check with the one used for survival rates on round end statitistics because, lets be honest here, we know that one works. Shuffles some flags around that should hopefully prevent round_converted() from running more than once. It's not a huge crisis if it does because late join antag is self capping, but still, not intended behavoir!
 Adds admin alert when random events fire Not sure why it took this long for this to happened. Will only trigger on random event firing, and not when an admin triggers an event to prevent unneeded duplicate messages Also triggers for events triggered by the wizard summon events Logs in the game log under the GAME: heading as well

 Reworks the pink/light pink slime line to not be nearly worthless to breed. Pink: Before: Replaced the slime mob with a peaceful simple animal version. This used to be ok, but then a friend system was added to slimes that meant you could have all the fun of not geting attacked by slimes without having to cripple their ability to defend themselves Now: Puts checks in to keep the slime from eating or targeting people, but keeping their friendships intact so the scientist can still make use of the system. Light Pink: Then: Same as pink, except you can use it on adult slimes to make equally pointless adult simple animals Now: Can be used on any mindless simple animal/monkey/slime to give them "sentience" aka player control drawn from ghosts with BE_ALIEN. Sample uses include: Weaponizing gold core mobs into working for you, using player mice to spy on people, providing an admitedly convoluted way to get player spiders in the round. Sepia: Then: It produces Cameras and film, readily accessble low demand items. Everyone laughs at this slime. Now: It still does that. Someone please figure out something for the sepia slime to do, its life is a joke.

 Adds a new species var, exotic_blood, that can be used with species that don't have traditional blood so you can still draw something from them if such a thing logically makes sense. It's used here to allow slime jelly to be drawn from slimepeople (and the far less seen jellypeople) In both cases slime jelly is produced from nutrition, and will always do so unless you've got either extremely low nutrition or extremely high slime jelly. Practical effects of this: *You can kill slimepeople in a few special ways, you can syrigne all the jelly out and once they run out of nutrition to replace it they'll stop breathing, chems that help clear toxins also screw them over BADLY in this way. *slimepeople get free access to a semipotent toxin whenever they want provided they have a syringe on hand, but have to manage their nutrition if they rely on it. *Other chems can be syringed wholesale out of slimepeople as well provided they haven't been metabolized yet.

 Adds optional population caps for those that want them. These be dark measures, so tread carefully ye who dare enter this place. There are three "levels" of popcaps, and you can use them in any assortment you like: The "soft" cap produces a message on join, and takes no action. The "hard" cap disallows joining whilst too many other people are alive and playing in game, but allows observing. The "extreme" cap prevents people from joining the server at all while the cap is exceeded. It won't kick out people who failed to qualify during roundstart, but if they leave they won't be able to get back in. In each case a customizable message config option has been given. Admins are also immune to most population caps (they still are hit by the ones in job shuffling, but can late join as normal afterwards)
 Adds work boots and fixes character setup previews.

 Reblob A blob bursting in space will cause a random valid crewmember to be infected. They'll have a short time to get to a good location before they burst. This means a lone blob bursting in space will not end the round unless there are no blob-valid crewmembers to choose from.
 Changelog This I think needs a changelog.
 Adds a necromantic stone capable of bringing 3 people back as skeletons bound to the user's will. Wizards can buy these.
 Makes blob more sensible Gives blobs who burst in space a 30 second warning before they're killed, and informs the admins that it's about to happen. Also changed the round ending logic to use the check_finished proc, rather than building it in to the blobize proc.
 Reverted Finite Bottles Also removed "g_amt" from bottle.dm and condiment.dm again.

Other: - Added "g_amt = 200" to bottle. - Added "g_amt = 500" to condiment.

 Making sure assistants get maint under additional access.
 It also turns out sec/assmaint is already included in additional access so I don't need to include them in the automatic toggle.
 Additional Access Re-evaluation Additional access hasn't been used nor even looked at since errorage first coded it years ago. Departments were moved around, accesses were added, removed, and moved around. This PR re-evaluates what additional access includes. The original idea was to give jobs most access to other workspaces in their department. For example, a medical doctor would be able to work anywhere in Medbay (Except CMO's office), so I'm going to keep with that direction.

 Article Font Change - Made articles use a different font. This font is the same as the one paper uses, so it should be safe to use. - Chagned message imput to not call return when the imput is "" or cancelled. Mostly to be standard with the rest.
 PDA Notekeeper 2.2 Notekeeper: - Now uses [PenCode](https://tgstation13.org/wiki/Paper_BBCode) rather than HTML. - Now uses the same font as paper. Meaning that signature has a different font, same as paper. - Editing the notes now uses **stripped_multiline_input** proc. - Cancelling the input box no longer deletes all the notes. - Added a horizontal rule between the Edit button and notes section. - Incremented the Notekeepers version number by 0.1 because of this new notekeeper update. - Scanning paper with your PDA now saves most of the content to the var that is shown as default text in the edit input box. - Scanning paper now states that it is saved to the notekeeper. - Can no longer scan blank paper. User is notificed of this. NTRC Chatroom: - Set Nick now does not allow "" as a name, and cancelling the input box doesn't delete the nick. - Set Channel now has a length limit of 15 rather than 255. - Message now does not send "" messages, and cancelling the input box doesn't send a message. - Added a horizontal rule between the buttons and notes section. Other: - Changed the **msg_input** proc to use **stripped_input**.

 Shuttle stranding: Removes fake recalls, the shuttle will arrive in rounds that usually would not allow shuttles (rev, malf, blob) but when the time comes for the shuttle to leave, it simply won't. What this does: -It gives a bonus ~8 minute delay to antag discovery on shuttle calls -It punishes crews that call the shuttle at first sign of danger by: --Rev: having the heads/potential converts huddle in predictable locations --Blob/Malf: Distracting focus from the antag -Gives a nice little OH SHIT moment when the shuttle doesn't launch Essentially this turns shuttle calls into something you wouldn't attempt without confirmation of the round type, which is the opposite of how it functions currently. Malf AIs also gain the ability to recall the shuttle to avoid the hard tell if they prefer.

 Automatic Round-start Access Scaling - Added a new config option MINIMAL_ACCESS_THRESHOLD that can be used to automatically give players more access during low-pop rounds. - If the number of players is below this threshold, expanded access will be used and security and assistants will have maintenance access. - If the number of players exceeds the threshold, minimal access will be used and security and assistants will not have maintenance access. - Setting the threshold to 0 will disable this function, and server ops can set the state of round-start access manually

 Adds bolt-action rifle Sprites from https://tgstation13.org/phpBB/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=2151 These have a bolt that needs to be worked after each shot, and they need it to be open in order to be reloaded. There is also a stripper clip. Their bullet does 60 brute damage, and the gun has a 5-shot internal magazine. They cannot be worn on the back slot as there are no back sprites provided in that file. Bayonets are not implemented for the same reason. The gun can be obtained as a 50% drop from ranged russian mobs (the other 50% still drop the mateba) and from summon guns.

 Merge pull request #6987 from pudl/efficiencyimprov efficiency improvements
 Magic Mania 1.82: 1 + 1 = 2 The challenge system wasn't properly rewarding wizards who used it because it deducted a use before it was given back, meaning I made summon guns/magic free to cast but didn't actually give any benifit to doing so. I'm going to take the fact that no one reported this bug as a pretty solid sign that people just would cast those things in either case.

 Adds a few extra tools
 Adds a new away mission: Underground Outpost 45 Underground outpost 45 is a large abandoned outpost built into a cave (which is also a gas pocket). It's mostly a leisure resort equipped with its own atmospherics filtering system, is fully self sustained with a large hydroponics bay, and has a lot of dormitory rooms and a big bar for its crew. The station, although abandoned, is fully operational and can continue being so as long as you can get some plasma or uranium into those generators. Currently the fluff for UO45 is missing entirely because nobody (myself included) can be arsed to write the gigantic amounts of crew logs to make it extra interesting. It's not really the point of this map, as it's mostly a stress test on away mission atmospherics and what sort of atmos environment I can have around it. Minor current issues: -May be lacking in sufficient amount of equipment -Gas filters in atmos do not start on for reasons unknown, but CAN be turned on Here is the map of the outpost: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12849736/UO45%20Map.png

 Merge pull request #6776 from TZK13/New-Emoji Adds new emojis and gives the QM's PDA a unique sprite
 Adds the new "E.X.P.E.R.I-MENTOR" research machine, an alternate research option. *Built with 1 scanning module, 2 manipulators and 2 micro lasers. *Manipulators affect the reset speed, lasers affect it's chance to have bad things happen. *Heavily RNG based to be the "fun" alternative. *Includes features such as causing spacial distortions, transforming things into other things, and setting your face on fire. *Can be built, but currently not included on the map. The process of the EXPERI-MENTOR works as such: 1. Build it/walk up to it and click the "Scan for R&D Console" button if it is there. 2. Insert anything, literally anything. 3. The user uses a process of elimination to guess what the correct use for the item is ("Poke", "Irradiate", "Gas", "Heat", "Cold" or "Obliterate") 4. A correct guess results in addition of research points and (potentially) a randomised thing happening (reduced with upgrades). A failed results in a fluff message. Current "use" RND events are: Poke *Destroy item, hit mobs in oview(1) for 15 brute *Destroy item, proceeding to Obliterate *Eject the item, throwing it at a random target in oview(7) Irradiate *Destroy item, apply 25 IRRADIATE to oview(1) *In oview(1), spawn goo in oview(1) *Transform item into something from valid_items list and eject it (primes grenades first) Gas *Destroy item, spawn toxic gas cloud *Spawn harmless gas cloud *Destroy item, Empulse(8,10) Heat *Destroy item, explosion(-1,0,0,0,0,flame_range = 2) (sets a small fire) *Destroy item, heat up turf *Eject item, spawn smoke, hit mobs for 5 burn in oview(1) Cold *Destroy item, release frostoil smoke *Destroy item, cool down turf *Eject item, spawn smoke Obliterate (by default, this will transfer m_amount and g_amount to a linked lathe) (I'm aware that both of these are kind of "one item at a time", but I like the effect and left it that way) *Destroy item, pull all mobs and items in oview(7) towards src *Destroy item, throw all mob and items in oview(7) at other mobs and items

 Merge pull request #6707 from phil235/HostileAttackingTargetFix Fixes player controlled hostile simple animal not calling AttackingTarget() for their melee attack.
 ERTHelmetLights+MinorERTAreaFix
 Adds "Split consciousness" a 100 cost, node requiring (think blobbernaut) power that produces a second blob overmind (with it's own unique reagent!) Alters code to require only 1 var instead of 4, alters some cases where blobs of a different colour change. Fixes the core and shield blobs of the overmind sometimes being a different colour to the rest. Makes blob spores the same colour as their overmind, but retain the husk icon in zombie mode (These are slightly off colour due to still being orange by default)

 SubSystem rewrite Misc: +Fixes unreported issue with initializing lighting on a specific zlevel +Fixes two similar issues with moveElement and moveRange. Where fromIndex or toIndex could be adjusted incorrectly in certain conditions. Potentially causing bad-sorts, or out of bound errors. +Rewrites listclearnulls(list/L) to no longer iterate through L.len elements for every null in the list (plus 1). i.e. went from L.len*(number_of_nulls+1) list-element reads (best-case), to L.len list-element reads (worst-case) +New proc/getElementByVar(list/L, varname, value) which finds the first datum in a list, with a variable named varname, which equals value. You can also feed it atoms instead of lists due to the way the in operator functions. +Fixes an unreported issue with Yota's list2text rewrite. Under certain conditions, the first element would not be converted into a string. Causing type-mismatch runtimes. +New global map_ready variable. This is not fully implemented yet, but will be used to avoid duplicate calls to initialize() for map objects. +All turfs now maintain references to all lights currently illuminating them. This will mean higher memory use unfortunately, due to the huge number of turfs. However, it will speed up updateAffectingLights significantly. I've used list husbandry to reduce baseline memory usage, so it shouldn't be any worse than some past atmos modifications memory-wise. -Removed 'quadratic lighting', can add this back at some point. Sorry. +modified the way lum() works slightly, to allow turfs to have overridden delta-lumen. i.e. space cannot be illuminated more than its default ambiance. This allowed removal of some iffy special-snowflake lighting areas implemented by somebody else. +Lighting images in the dmi can now use arbitrary naming schemes. It is reliant on order now. This allows the dmi to be replaced by simply dropping in a new dmi. -Removed all subtypes of /area/shuttle. Shuttles now create duplicate 'rooms' of /area/shuttle. (More on this later). This will conflict with most maps. Guide on how to fix to follow. +All verbs/tools relating to world.tick_lag were refactored to use world.fps. However old config text for setting tick_lag will still work (it converts the value to fps for you) +MC stats improved using smoothing. They now have their own tab so they dont get in the way when you're playing as an admin. -removed the push_mob_back stuff due to conflicting changes. Sorry Giacom. _OK, NOW THE ACTUAL INTERESTING STUFF_ Following systems moved over to subsystem datums: air_master garbage_manager lighting_controller process_mobs (aka Life()) nanomanager power sun pipenets AFK kick loops shuttle_controller (aka emergency shuttle/pods), supply_shuttle and other shuttles voting bots radio diseases events jobs objects ticker Subsystems hooks and variables should be commented fairly in-depth. If anything isn't particularly clear, please make an issue. Many system-specific global variables have been refactored into All tickers which previously used world.timeofday now use world.time some subsystems can iterate before round start. this resolves the issue with votes not working pregame

 Sugar reagent's nutriment_factor is now 50% higher (but its nutritious value still depends on your nutrition level). Fast nutrition drain due to sugar is now 3 times the normal drain (instead of 5 times) The 'good' nutrition level icons (blue, green, yellow) are now semi-transparent.

 Ports the rapid pipe dispenser (RPD) from /vg/ These are pocket devices that dispense unwrenched atmos/disposal pipes. Despite the admittedly misleading name, these have infinite ammo. There is no need to reload with matter cartridges or anything like that. Currently, they spawn in atmos tech lockers, and as an engiborg module. More can be obtained with the autolathe. They are also a traitor "steal item" objective.

 Magic Mania 1.8: Summon Spells Rework and The Challenge System Summon Guns and Summon Magic are no longer traditional spells. When cast by the wizard, he gains a charge for his spell book but no antagonists are created, essentially making his life harder for more power. Both spells can only be cast once like this for a maximum of 2 extra charges. When cast by very rare chance in summon events, no charages are gained, and there's a 10% chance of someone becoming a survivor, down from 25%. No charges are gained if this happens. When cast by a badmin they will be given a choice of not creating antags, creating antags at the old chance, or just going in stupid and giving everyone antag.

Rearranging datum/reagents, all "good" medical reagents are under datum/reagent/medicine/ and all food&drink reagents are under datum/reagent/consumable. Adding a pizza crate to cargo orders. Growns and cooked food are given vitamins while junk food are all given sugar. Removed some unnecessary code in Chemistry-Reagents.dm . high satiety+fed = higher metabolism_efficiency, lower if starving. Sugar digested drains satiety and vitamin raises satiety. Negative satiety means faster nutrition drop. Positive high satiety means lower chance to spread viruses. metabolism efficiency affect metabolization speed of healing and damaging reagents and the efficiency of bodytemp stabilization via calory use.

 Ports the supermatter engine from /vg/ The SM was originally developed for bay12, but I ported the /vg/ fork. Basically, it eats heat or atom/movables and generates radiation/power. Everything that touches it turns to dust. If it overheats, it explodes. Typical usage involves emitters and a cooling chamber. Currently, these are only obtainable through cargo for 100 points. The crate comes locked and requires CE access.

 Interface for using boost::regex in byond. Regex is a robust text-parsing mini-language. It can perform complex and dynamic searches and return the results in an easy to read format. This implementation also uses Boost's extended formatting syntax which gives you a flexible way to conditionally replace complex strings with only a few lines of code Source code and license info can be found here: http://code.google.com/p/byond-regex/ Licensed under LGPL. This uses the perl regex syntax (with some extensions) in non-recursive mode (as recursion has additional overheads). Information on this syntax can be found here: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_55_0/libs/regex/doc/html/boost_regex/syntax/perl_syntax.html There are many introductions to regex on the internet. Here is the one I learned from: http://www.regular-expressions.info/tutorial.html Note: I have added #define USE_BYGEX in code/_compile_options.dm. Simply comment out the define if you encounter any problems. Due to byond being unable to communicate with a dll through anything but C-strings, the results are returned to byond in a string similar to those you get with list2params. Since byond uses parameters a lot, its params2list() proc is fairly streamlined, so it's pretty much the fastest way you could do this with byond. This data is then stored in a datum/regex object for easy use. See demo.dm datum/regex/proc/report() for an example.

 Exosuit fabricator revamp Exosuits will now use the designs from RnD to create objects instead of having the object already created on their contents. Each one of the default items to build are now designs. Removed access required to use the exosuit fabricators. Removed an unused mech syringe gun design and replaced with a new one, with no cost. Added a temporal object, /obj/item/mechavars, to be able to use initalize() for the construction time. This will be later on removed and the construction time will be ported to the design datums. Some minors issues are still present, due to the amount of files needed to fix these, it won't be part of this commit, but a future one. Fixes issue #3893 Removed required access to access the setting controls of the RnD console.
 added deconstructing
 changelog for recent updates
 Merge pull request #5690 from Nienhaus/master Updates the beret to not look like a codersprite V2!
 Singularity tweaks Fix an off-by-one error that caused the singulo to get stuck along contaiment fields. For a 5x5 singulo, it would check 6 squares ahead (correct for a step forward) and then 6 squares to the sides (incorrect). Now it tests 6 squares ahead, 5 to the sides. This is technically wrong for the growth checks but they check every direction anyways, so it's ok. Made the singularity drift in all cases and not stop next to lattices. In process(), moved the growth checks after the movement attempt so it will take a step and then grow rather than take a step, drift into the walls, and then attempt and fail to grow as part of the next process().
 Fix
 Removing some "text(...)" stuff. Little fixes in closets.dm Adding bullet_act, blob_act and ex_act to fireaxecabinet so it drops the axe when destroyed. You can now break the cabinet's glass with projectiles (with damage >=15). Adding ex_act to extinguisher cabinet so it sometimes drops the extinguisher when destroyed.

Adding missing attack logs.
 Changes messages to be more appropriate for last commit + more fluffy.
 Fix for infinite loop
 Extends the check to include the number of potential laws, from the current aiModule (eg, total_laws (10) + potential laws on board (4) = 14, 14 > 12)
 Adds a config option for capping the amount of laws silicons can receive via boards, defaults to 12
 Fixes inconsistencies with the player panel Every other admin window that deals with singular things (vv, traitorpanel, etc) lets you have more then one open (as long as its not about the same thing), But not pp, the central point of all of them. This fixes that and allows you have a window open for each mob.

Attack_animal for silicons: all in silicon/attack_animal() Attack_slime handled in living, overriden in its children. Simplified the definition of the stunprob var, slight nerf to slime shock.
 Draft of airlock bolt cutting and repairing.
 Partial Fix Partially fixes the bug of the RPED not using better parts when installing parts to an incomplete machine. It is still possible for it to not use top tier parts, however, if More than two tiers of the same part exist.

 ATTACK_HAND in aliens: Moving attack_hand for larva+humanoid to alien/attack_hand() in alien_defense to handle both. Changing weaken() to paralyze() in alien/attack_hand() in hulk and disarm section because weaken fails on aliens. lowered alien bite damage on alien to just 1 in all cases, instead of rand(1,3) for humanoid->humanoid. Added alien/attack_hand() to handle both larva and humanoid, with override in the children. Adding a death message for the larva.

 moved attack_slime to carbon/alien to handle both larva and humanoid, with a little override in larva and humanoid. Created proc/grabbedby in mob/living/living_defense.dm to handle all grab stuff in the attack_hand's and attack_alien's. Fixed typos in messages. one attack_larva gets a return attack_alien for its harm part. Fixing larva attack on larva, couldn't help a fellow larva. moving humanoid/attack_larva to alien/attack_larva() to handle both humanoid and larva being attacked by larva. Fix a bug with attack_slime where you could glomp a dead humanoid indefinitely.

 Some small fixes
 Adds Nien's HoS formal sprites so they dont look like a Prince suit.
 Gives bots their own place in the MC! - Adds bots to the Master Controller as their own datum instead of machines. - Puts bots into their own global list. - Processes bots asynchronously so as to not hold up the MC processing them.
 Firefighting changes: -Firesuit level protection will not entirely protect you from being set on fire. You will gain small amounts of heat while on fire. -Overhauls the Atmos Water Backpack into a more effective firefighting tool -Adds a secure ATMOS closet containing said atmos water backpack to the code, but is not on the map as the backpack already exists in the ATMOS hardsuit object at this moment

 Fixes a few carp and alien sprites What it says on the tin. It changes the regular space carp to be dark blue like they were on NT, so it fits with the megacarp. Really almost anything would have been better than the neon pink we have right now. Fixes hunter sneak sides with weird bright borders, updates the alien pounce stances to use the latest ones.
 Botcall Fix for MC lag + Tweak to floorbots - Attempts to fix a major screwup in bot movement code that created artificial lag for the entire Master Controller. - Fixes floorbots not patrolling or performing certain functions. - You can now toggle the anchored status on Floorbots manually. They will still automatically anchor when fixing hull breaches. Allow me to apologize for taking so long to come up with a fix for this. I tried several other solutions such as simply removing the sleep(4) that causes this issue (it results in 'teleportation' movement). Other times I used spawn() incorrectly, resulting in several race conditions. And then I tried to give them their own ticker, independent of the MC. The game lagged and runtimed before it even finished setting up. Excuses aside, this solution seems to be working so far, but I welcome any more elegant solutions to fixing this issue. fixes #5560
 cleaned up procs, added glass table smashing

 RPED Expansion Ports https://github.com/NTStation/NTstation13/pull/982 from NT. Summary of changes: - The Rapid Part Exchange Device (RPED) can now install stored parts into unfinished machines! Once you have installed a circuit board to the frame, use the RPED to add any required parts contained inside, then finish with a screwdriver! - Identical parts in the RPED are now shown in groups, just like a mining satchel. - RPED storage capacity increased. It can now contain up to 50 parts, fewer if power cells are added as well. Maximum weight class of 100 (parts except power cells are class 2). <b>The storage values are up for discussion. I chose the original values based on the mining satchel.<\b> Unrelated: - The admin-only debug research item now includes plasma and engineering tech.

 Icecream vat overhaul. Fixes all the bugs it had. BUG LIST: Beaker can't be used to add reagents to vat, it goes directly inside the vat and the vat doesn't detect what's inside the beaker. Beaker is useless and its reagents (whatever they are) are used when making icecream. Cannot put just a bit of reagents in the vat, it empties all the item's reagents or nothing. Click icecream vat with a snack it will take all the reagents, the snack doesn't disappear until you try to eat it. "Vinny Saylor has emptied all of the egg into the icecream vat." The vat doesn't work w/o power Cant dispense cones if their total amount is bigger than 11. take empty bottle stuff, click on vat, it still says that you empty the content in it. scooping flavored icecream uses vanilla icecream as well..

 Feedback reporting now uses 1 insert query with mutiple rows Rather then making a new query for each feedback item. Each query can take between 25ms and 100ms, and this is a static per-query overhead, so removing the 60 or so needless querys will speed things up.
 Some runtimes here. There might be a significant underlying problem though, with null mobs in important lists.
 Removes some sql related lag caused by too many clients connecting at once after a restart (and other minor fixes to client sql logic) Clients will now spread out their sql database connection logging and related ckey by ip/cid searching at world start so it doesn't all happen at once. Fixes a minor bug with related ckey searching where only one would be returned. Fixes a minor bug where related ckey searching would return the client's own ckey.

 Space movement rewrite to allow everything to drift Removes a version of atom/movable/Move() that was in mob_movement.dm. New proc called newtonian_move() that's called as a result of things like shooting a gun or spraying a fire extinguisher and as part of atom/movable/Move(). It pushes src if it's not under gravity and gives the object a chance to stop itself. As a result, inertial_drift() is kill. Moved Process_Spacemove() out to atom/movable. It does the same thing, it's called whenever a drift is attempted and stops the drift if it returns 1. Default check is to look for nearby lattices to make dragging shit around the station less annoying. Mobs still call it in Client/Move() The mob version of Process_Spacemove() will shove non-anchored nearby objects out of the way if you try to move like that. For example if you're free-floating in space next to a closet and try to move right, the closet will drift off to the left. Mechs call their occupant's version of Process_Spacemove() so mining with a mech isn't retarded. The pussy wagon does the same thing and thus no longer works like a jetpack. Will it be making a comeback?!?! (no) Any move will attempt to keep dragging your pulled object, not just ones initiated by the client. Should make space wind a little less annoying. Was needed to make drifting not break your drags. Mechs drift correctly without any special snowflake crap. Spaceslipping is gone because fuck that shit Space movement is now slow instead of fast. Having a jetpack helps go faster but even that's slower than current. Hopefully means nuke ops can see each other as they move to the station instead of losing sight of each other instantly. Having your hands full makes spacemovement even slower. You can drift in office chairs and drag mobs in beds or the bed itself. Currently drifting diagonally while in an office chair is bugged and I need help to solve it. It winds up in cardinal movement instead of a diagonal one. Changes up the jetpacking effects system to cause fewer errant ion trails but it's still awful code. In hindsight I shouldn't have bothered but here we go.

 little fix
 Wrapping something with package wrapper now gives a message. Adding a check so clicking an already giftwrapped item doesn't show the wrapping message. Adding nobludgeon flag to wrapping paper to remove attack messages Removing w_class line from package wrapper because already in its parent. Remove the unnecessary message (box is full/packagewrapper doesn't fit in the box) when wrapping box. Fixes not being able to wrap box with just one single package wrapper left. Fixing attack_log (fix issue4180) and only adds log when the wrapping succeeds. Now using wrapping paper actually uses its amount. when all used, they will drop cardboard tube like intended. Fixes issue4207 Fixes not being able to re-add wrapping paper and package wrapper to themselves like proper stacks. New sprite for both paperwrap and cardboard tube. (from Nienhaus)

 Movement rebuilding and bot changes, Pt 1. - Created a proc to handle all bot movement, including patrols and PDA/AI summons. *NOT ALL BOTS ARE YET CONFIGURED TO USE IT!* That is for part 2. - Made/making bots faster while moving except for Secbots (balance issues) and MULEs (already super sanic). They will move twice per tick while moving/patrolling, and three times while summoned (PDA/AI) *PROCESS INCOMPLETE* - Gave bots a central ignore list for turfs they cannot reach, with a matching proc to use it. - New Scan() proc that will soon replace the highly similar ones in certain bots. Part of the effort to trim down on their repeated code. Added a define that defaults to 7 for view range. - Small tweak to the topic_denied() proc to use the user given by the primary topic. - Central process() proc so universal things for all bots can be easily added. (Except MULEs) Must return a 1 for child process() to run after it. - Corrected a spelling error. - Removed the extra path vars (summon_path, patrol_path, call_path) in favor of just using "path". - Compatibility changes to the summon and patrol procs. - Slightly tweaked cleanbot logic, removed some useless code, updated them to use the new scan() and bot_move() procs. Rest to follow. - Updated MULEbots to work with the new summon code. - Various small tweaks.

 Fix for #5247
 fixes zipeties typo
 fixes icon update
 fixes mc crash from training bomb
 Changes the path of electropacks from objitemdeviceradioelectropack to objitemdeviceelectropack. Fixes some runtimes related to electropacks. Securing electropacks will no longer be required to use a helmet on it, same with dissembling the shockkit with a wrench or placing it in a chair. Removes the atom var 'moved_recently' that was only used by electropacks (really). Now the electropack will have an inner cooldown instead. The cooldown of the shock will be 10 seconds, giving the shocked person some small time to move in-between shocks (the shock gives you 5 of weakened).
 rolled jumpsuit touchups
 Manage Free Slots Converts the nearly useless List Free Slots command to Manage Free Slots From here you can painlessly add and remove job slots to your hearts content because the HoP is Dead/Shit/AFK/In Hiding It can't be used before round start to make rounds with only clowns because of jobs.txt being applied at round start. Alas.
 Fixes the winddoor at the security checkpoint in arrivals, it wont't runtime at roundstart anymore.
 fixes the two tiles
 Added NOTICE() for world.log messages that aren't errors or warnings. The message that SDQL2 query outputs will now properly state the ckey of the user.

 Href exploit fixing : the bugfree edition
 Fixing sandstone stacking.
 Fixes the ability to make stacks of grasstile/sandstone larger than the max amount authorized. Fixes an error in the amount of grasstiles produced. Fixes some unnecessary capitalisation in mineral deposit names.
 New PA and space suit sprites: Attempt Two Uses sprites from flashkirby, refer to previous PR for what everything looks like. Also improves various alien sprites, but they're still blue don't worry.
 Shortens stopped tube time and cleans up a bit
 Adding passtable and passgrille to obj/effect/effect and its children so effects aren't blocked by tables and grilles.
 Adding a CanPass() proc to girders. Projectiles can now sometimes pass through them, with varying percentage chance depending on girder subtypes. Fixing reinforced and disloged girders being called "reinforced" or "disloged" upon examination instead of "disloged girder" and "reinforced girder". Adding passtable and passgrille to mice for consistency, because chicks already have those flags.
 Fixes the bug with Gygax/Durand armour welding sprites looping infinitely

 Turret SFX and spawning changes * Turrets now use the SFX associated with the weapon installed in them * Turrets now have a default installed gun for when they are spawned * fire_sound is now a property of all ammunition, not just energy ammo, which should make future additions a lot simpler. * Added some energy gun SFX handling to the giant switch statement at the top of portable_turret.dm, because 'emagged' and 'lethal' are the same thing and have to be handled weirdly. * The upshot of all these changes is that every turret, constructed or default, should make exactly the right noise, even if guns are added in the future!

 Tablecrafting improvements: Allow more than one result. All components will be placed inside the first result in the list. Completion of crafting will now reset the interface, if possible. Opening the interface now causes you to face the table.
 - Changelings no longer receive the absorb objective. The objective was broken because of the interaction between extract DNA and hivemind. - New objective 'Escape with identity' requires the changeling to have the DNA and ID of their target when escaping - Hallucination and transformation stings and engorged glands now require 3 absorptions. - Can't purchase abilities you can't use. Cleans up the evolution menu. - Extract DNA sting costs 1 point and doesn't count towards absorptions. - Increased chemical recharge rate from 0.5 to 2. Engorged glands increase recharge rate by 1. - You can absorb people even if you have their DNA already

 Hopefully the final pass of initial tweaks and fixes for summon events *Reworks teleporation so change places doesn't leave people distantly locked to chairs *Adds a sanity check for improved spellcasting for some badmin abuse *Delays zombie outbreak from occuring until 20 minutes into the round because it was often occuring before there was ample dead *Removes the earmuffs from the cursed items loadout for being neither fun nor useful to anyone *Removes the fake explosion from summon events for losing its appeal once it was expected, it still exists as a badmin event though. *Reels in the 4th wall shattering nature of the greentext a bit *Adds a message to affected people for Change Races, since some people are so decked out in gear they wouldn't even notice anything had happened *Fixes change names to actually work *Rewrites change minds to avoid edge cases where some people could be swapped twice back into their original body

Let me know if I'm missing overlooking something) - Bumped lingchat sense chance up to 40% Resolves #4860

 New wooden walls, dark tile colors and warning lines, knotted wire changes. Like the title says. Pics of the new walls, floors and slightly changed knotted wires in a moment. Also adds myself to the changelog, I've been around for about 3 years.
 Calling the shuttle during Red Alert will now announce the correct time Instead of 10 minutes every time.
 Adds some missing checks for need_job_assign which caused Wizard and Nuke op AIs and HoS Cultists
 "doortype" var is now the build path for the door assembly of each airlock. This simplifies the code. Deconstructing freezer airlock now gives proper freezer door assembly (instead of nothing).
 Summary: Fixing duplicating exploits of APC and air alarm electronics. Changing some span classes. Fixing some typos. Standardizing the span classes used for operations on alarms, APC, airlocks/door assembly. List of Fixes: * airlock: Fixes spam success message when crowbaring airlock electronic (needs just one success message even if many crowbar click) * airlock fix: installing two electronics at same time on door assembly installs one and eats one. * air alarm fix: "You pry out the circuit." success message spam. Plus electronics duplication plus sound playing for each success times. * Fixes for spamclick when cutting APC terminal (fix Runtime error) * APC fix: whenremoving APC electronics, Success message spam. Electronics duplication. * Fire alarm fix: can no longer move/do stuff during wait period for electronics removal of fire alarm. * Span class changes: replacing danger by warning when there's no danger involved. * APC/airlock/alarms Changes: Every action with a duration now has a visible 'initial' message for third parties w/ warning span (3rd parties need to know before action is over, not after)(unless the action has multiple outcome/or is dangerous then the other way around (circuit removal from APC) or third party msg at both start and end) * Message Changes: (for alarms/airlocks/APC operations) For the user, the initial 'trying' msg is standardised to no span, and success msg for user is 'notice'. * adding some selfmessages * replacing for(in view())+show_message by visible_message. * Deaf people no longer hear bolt toggling clicksound.
 Names Nuke Op Leader's ID card To make it easier to identify who has it, especially if it starts getting passed around.

 Adds z.7 (dead space 2) to boxstation because no one seemed particularly offended by the idea. This closes the cube properly there and prevents a few weird edge cases where closed loops of Z.6 to Z.6 transitions could happen. Meta/Mini should add empty z.7 at some point after this pull is committed, I would have done so myself but it didn't play nice with mapmerge so I decided against it.

 Config Option to Bar Lizards from Authority Roles aka formalizing Human Supremacy - Adds a config option ENFORCE_HUMAN_AUTHORITY which prevents lizard players from joining Command and Security roles [Lizard subjugation intensifies]
 Added some <BR>s to Minor Announcements - Makes them look nicer with the title on it's own line - Makes them a bit more noticeable
 Securitrons will only arrest unidentifiable persons when ID check is on - Sec bots will check if the person is "Unknown" and without an ID if idcheck is on. This means beepsky will stop targetting people at the HoP line, or officers changing his settings. It's meant to target disguised people, as I had originally intended. - However, sec bots, unable to identify monkeys, will start arresting them if idcheck is on - Agent IDs buffed to reduce threat level by 5 instead of 2

The PR changes the formula to thus: Antagonists = min ( population / (2* coeff ) + 2, population / coeff ) For traitor, this means Traitors = min ( population / 10 + 2, population / 5 )

TimSort is ever so slightly slower than Insertion and Merging on random lists. But on lists with natural runs (partially sorted data) it is far faster than all others. The old merge sort was removed and replaced with timSort. Other algorithms are provided as alternatives. All algorithms use a central datum, so accept many of the same parameters. For instance, setting associative=1 will make them sort associative lists by their associated values, rather than keys. They also accept a cmp argument. This allows sorting of lists of datums, text, numbers or whatever. The pre-existing helpers in lists.dm were rewritten as examples.

 Fixes manifold pipe initialization, they would place the same connection on several nodes. Fixes the qdel() of pipes, scrubbers, vents and others atmos related machines. Adds an error message when a pipe is in at least two pipenets. Adds a new proc to add pipes to a pipenet datum, addMember(). Stops the mass creation of pipenet datums that would not be used. Makes pipenet datums more stable, a pipe will be a member of only one pipenet datum. Removes a lot of initialization() and build_network() calls around pipe code. Pipes can now be wrenched without the need of a connector next to them.

 fixed reinforced tables Fixes not being able to place wrenches on (unweakened) reinforced tables. The return statement in the conditional for the wrench in attackby was preventing control from reaching the conditional later on that places the wrench on the table. The conditional for the wrench now checks if it can destroy the table, and if not it continues down to where it is then placed on the table. table_destroy is now guaranteed to destroy the table. Also removed the now redundant check in table_destroy and made it more portable between different kinds of tables. Also fixed an obvious typo.
 Adds the magicarp event as a rare happening.

 Runtime fix
 Fixes issue where Crew Monitors can only detect suit sensors on z1 It was meant to only scan its own zlevel, but when AI crew monitoring was added, it was changed to scan only z1. Which makes the monitoring console on mining go entirely against the purpose for which it was added, which was to find missing miners. I also included some minor remapping on the mining bases to give more room in the medical area, and xeno warning signs for the northern outpost.

 gameticker.dm
 Official End-of-Round Declaration The end of the round will be clearly printed for all players to see. This is especially useful for new players, when it's not exactly clear when the round ends. Doubly so if there is no AI or antagonists, so no end-round report shows up at all. For flavour, if you participated in the round, it will also tell you if you survived, died, or were marooned.

 Can add maroon and destroy via Traitor Panel
 Maroon and Destroy objectives for Traitor and Changeling Maroon -Maroon objectives are a variation of assassination, where preventing the escape of the person also counts as a success. -Aprox. 30% of assasinations will be maroonings instead -Disincentivizes players from staying behind on the station when the shuttle leaves simply because "it's more safe" Destroy -Basically an assasination objective where the AI is the target -All traitors have a 1% of getting this objective. Changelings have 2% chance. -Adds variety, counterplay between those who want to destroy the AI and save/restore/steal it -It is entirely possible to get Destroy AI and Steal AI at the same time. While it would be difficult, it's still entirely possible to destroy your target and steal a different AI. The chances of getting both are very slim, however. -Encourages restoring the AI over killing it wherever possible. Discourages AIs from cooperating with antagonists. And there you go, my hamhanded attempts at some new objective types.

 AI Medical sensors ignore binary life mode.
 whoops missed balancing an event
 Nerfs to AI's HUDs - AI Medical HUDs require that the person's suit sensors be enabled (any active mode) in order to view status data. - AI Security HUDs display only the person's job as given by their ID, no security status or implant detection.
 This fixes Zombified Ian
 RR's tweak + derpfix Makes the sensor augmentation check for silicon instead of one for both the AI and Borgs, since they are not actually different procs. Reverts an accidental removal of the borg camera function, thinking it came from NT's code.

 Fixes errors caused by copytext being a shit Basically, copytext's first argument is inclusive, but its 2nd argument isn't. so copytext("123456789", 2, 8) returns 234567. When I googled "byond copytext" (to see how it worked in byond and if it used 1 or 0 based indexing) the first link is http://www.byond.com/docs/guide/chap15.html and this does nothing to spell this out. The reference guide (that i should have used) spells this out more clearly, but it is confusing none the less: http://www.byond.com/docs/ref/info.html#/proc/copytext
 Silicon Medical and Security HUDs! - The AI can now access both Security and Medical HUDs via a new button on its UI. The Medical HUD is exactly equal to all others. The AI's Security HUD cannot detect implants. - Cyborg HUD modules have been removed in favor of an inbuilt command, to make it less of a hassle to access them. - HUD code has been given its own file such that it can be used by any mob. In addition, HUD users are placed into a list instead of searching for only humans and checking them for a HUD item. This is to make it easier to expand. - Security HUD messages can now be received by any mob using a SecHUD.
 Trigger Events verb will now ask if the admin wants to announce to the crew Additionally, -Create virus re-added to secrets menu, as it had options to specify a specific virus to create -Blob added to One-Click-Antag with the option to set the strength of the blob (1=Weak, 2= Strong, 3=Full)

 Fix empty author records being written.
 Added Changelog Management System. A frequent problem on all SS13 codebases is keeping the changelog up to date, as the changelog is a horrible nightmare of bad HTML. On top of this, pull requests that modify the changelog often cause merge conflicts. For this reason, codebases without a strict update process don't bother updating the changelog. To solve this, we at /vg/ propose this system, which decentralizes the changelog entries by developers into one changelog per developer (reducing the chance of a conflict), AND simplifies them into YAML, which is far simpler for git to handle. Changelog *generation* is now performed centrally after a batch of PRs are pulled, and the system automatically generates HTML and timestamps everything. A central "database" also keeps track of all changes to prevent duplication and allow further updates to be added to the same date, without creating a mess. A templating system is also installed, to allow some customization of the output product without having to dig around in the python code. * Port requested by Cheridan. * Timestamp system has been updated to handle /tg/'s special snowflake timestamp format. * I've also had to fix some typos in the changelog itself in order to get the dates to parse, otherwise, b(e)yond some indenting changes and comment removal, it's identical to the old changelog. * Python 2.7 is required to run the genchangelog tool, as is PyYaml and BeautifulSoup 4. * And yes, I tested this, for once.

 Calibrations for Teleporter As the RD is expected to frequently use the teleporter to reach the AI chamber (Which he is supposed to maintain) the mutation chance has been a real pain in the ass. Calibrating the teleporter is meant to make it safer to use at the cost of time. -You can now calibrate the stationary teleporter before you use it -Calibrating the teleporter will remove the chance of mutation -Calibration takes time (Defaut 10 Secs). The better parts the hub has, the shorter the wait -If the teleporter has been upgraded to use the best possible parts, calibration will not be necessary -Changing targets or using the teleporter will decalibrate the teleporter
 -Sechuds are notified when a prisoner has met his quota and moved the shuttle back on station. This is to let security know that there are minerals available, and that they should pick up the filled prisoner ID from the console -Shuttle points console will no longer open the release door while the shuttle is still on the labor camp dock. This is to prevent players from being trapped on the bottom half of the shuttle, as they're unable to reach the console again to move the shuttle -Added a points checking machine on the labor camp to raise awareness that there usually IS a quota that will release you when met

 Minor Announcements Head of Staff announcements (ie the ones made via request consoles) are now "Minor Announcements".

They're basically meant to be big and noticable, but not as annoying and spammy as Priority Announcements. I wanted to include a sound for them, but I've been unable to find one I was satisfied with.

 Magic Mania 1.67: Great Balls of Fireballs Changes the wand of fireball projectile to have the same !!FUN!! proximity detonation properties as the spell version. Slightly moved the damage types from getting hit by the fireball around to better simulate the experience. Fun fact about spell fireballs: Because the projectile is desiged to explode if it comes within a square of somebody who isn't the wizard direct contact between fireballs and mobs is very rare. This means that while the fireballs are designed to do an extra 25 brute and 20 burn ON CONTACT this usually doesn't happen. That's why the added damage on the wand here isn't 25/20, because that would actually make it signigicantly better than the spell.

 Burglar Alarm for Captain's Display Case -Breaking the Captain's Display Case will now trigger an alarm, bolting all airlocks in the room as well as notifying the AI (after a 3 second delay) Nowadays, I'm seeing far too many Captains breaking their display case with little repercussion. Keeping the gun in the case used to have value when the AI was able to watch over it (hear people breaking it), but since the AI was moved there's no value in keeping it in there besides to avoid being accused of powergaming. This change is meant to add incentive for Captains to keep it in the case (Extra Security), humiliates them from taking it (bells and whistles will draw everyone's attention), and makes the steal objective a little more unique from the other ones. Traitors would need to create their own escape route first, or be extremely predictable jump down the disposal outlet. An alternative to bolting the airlocks (should it be seen as being too extreme) would be to simply drop firedoors instead.

 Make new_players GC when observing When observing, that observer would be given their original new_player's mind, but that mind would still have the new_player as its current. This caused the new_player to fail to GC and resulted in the observer's mind's current becoming null. Fix: Just delete the new_player mind when the player observes. If an admin turns them into a human or whatever, a new mind will be created automatically then.

 Bugfix With Mechs (mecha.dm) Added in a check to see if the mech a player is trying to enter has a health value greater than 0. This fixes a bug whereby if a player is entering a mech as it is destroyed, their mob gets deleted and the player loses connection to the server. Reconnecting to the server allows this player to rejoin the game, but as a new person.
 added two defines CLICK_CD_RANGE and CLICK_CD_MELEE (4 and 8), replaced all changeNext_move() procs to use these two defines. Added melee click cooldown for paper spam on cameras.

 Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/tgstation/-tg-station into track_bugs Conflicts: code/modules/mob/living/silicon/ai/ai.dm
 AI Tracking bugfixes Fixes #4201 by adding a cancel button to the track mob list. Fixes a runtime that pops up if you double click the "Track Mob" or "Show Camera List" buttons on the AI hud. Problem is that double clicking runs a proc that builds the datum of lists of trackable mobs twice, and then both procs sleep because of input(). When the first track completes it nulls the tracking datum, which causes problems for the second (or more) tracks which expect the tracking datum to not be null. Solution: Keep the datum around and simply rebuild the lists as-needed instead of creating and deleting the tracking datum datum pointlessly.
 Merge pull request #3644 from Kaezon/master Drop contents on ex_act()
 Mining Machines: Implementing ex_act() Implemented ex_act() in both the ore redemption machine and the mining vendor. Sparks were added as a feedback for any explosion that call ex_act() on these machines. To allow for the reconstruction of these devices, I have implemented machine recepies and circuitboard definitions for these devices. I also added R&D recipies for the circuitboards. Offline and Open icons have been added for both objects. Squashed all of my previous commits and fixed the leftover garbled code from my original rebase.

 Fixes some issues with mechs getting deleted Mechs delete correctly, and delete their special looping iterator datums just for good measure. Also now sanity check them because now they can be null. Fixes #4067 hopefully. This issue is impossible to repro alone and even then it's one-in-a-million, but I've removed a bunch of spawn()s that only served to create a window one can jump inside between the mech running the deletion proc and actually running Destroy() and setting loc = null. I've also added two safeguards to make sure it doesn't happen in the future. Can't enter a deleted mech and getting deleted kicks anyone inside out just to be sure. Removed the super pointless obj/mecha/proc/destroy(). Even when this was written, it should have just been in Del()!

 *Removes the 95% probability chance of any attempt to harvest meat from various simple animals to fail after dropping one meat. This also means the gib animation will always properly play (provided it exists). *Meat spawning removed from harvest(), it's always been handled in gib.

 Notifications + Random Stuff Adds sound notifications for Ninja and Wizard Apprentice spawning -- hopefully means fewer afk antags. Adds a ghostnotice span class, used in the new notify_ghosts proc. Upon creation, things that require ghostly attention (NarSie, golem runes) give more visible messages to the dead. Retires the 'moderate' span class, which was only used in tomato throwing? Refactors tomato code (this ended up being the meat of this PR, somehow...) Reorganizes some item definition/procs.
 Syringes will switch to draw mode if emptied into plots. All reagent containers have icon updated after plot-use, including droppers. Droppers updated to use update_icon instead of that "filled" variable. Typo in irrigation fixed, allowing liquid > 30 units to be spread amongst connected trays. Changelog updated, including some things from previous PRs which I didn't add at the time.
 Removed an unused suicide_act proc belonging to the scalpel.
 Adds a lower cap for latejoing antagonists -If the number of antagonists is 2 less than the current cap, the next latejoiner will be guaranteed to get antagonist -Reduced latejoin antag cap to (Number of joined players/ Scaling Coefficient) This should result in a more controlled population of antagonists while still keeping it unpredictable for players in-game.

 Adds Radioactive Microlaser Adds the radioactive microlaser, a device disguised as a health analyzer used to irradiate people, as a traitor item. It costs 4 telecrystals to purchase, and is fairly powerful in clever hands. The strength of the radiation is determined by the 'intensity' setting, while the delay between the scan and the irradiation kicking in is determined by the wavelength. Each scan will cause the microlaser to have a brief cooldown period. Higher intensity will increase the cooldown, while higher wavelength will decrease it. Wavelength is also slightly increased by the intensity as well.
 Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaarghhhhh IN MY DEFENSE, you can't actually be set on fire in the first place if you have HEATRES or NOFIRE in your specflags, so it was easy for me to overlook this one. This is really more of an issue with BYOND than anything else.

 Fixes the gravity generator not updating your gravity status, so you stop floating.
 Add logging to failed GC's that result in a del() call You can view these logs in-game using a debug verb. You have to use the debug-verbs command to see it. Removed the dellogging compile option. If this is a problem, speak up, but for most users, this new functionality is more useful.

 Changed IEDs into firebombs. Changed IEDs into firebombs to curtail the amount of station damage done whilst keeping IEDs useful and still keeping fuel tank bombs a useful saboteur's tool. Their fuse time is a bit more variable too, including a 1 in 10 chance of them going off practically straight away (note: this is counter-able by the user wearing a fire-suit, git gud and l2p)

 Merge branch 'adminhelp-links' into 'nextversion' Adminhelp links Adds adminmoreinfo links to referred jobs that are only held by one person to speed up admin work. Common abbreviations are accounted for. Jobs that are held by multiple people are deliberately removed since only one of them would be returned. I thought providing multiple links doesn't help a lot in these situations since there will be no way to know which one the ahelper is referring to. If only one person is found with a job that can be held by multiple people, the job name will have the link however.

 Fixes supply console being stuck at Invalid Request screen by adding the Back link at a more convenient spot.
 fixes exploits with the mech fabricator (/tg/) this exploit is in all public builds i could look at. using the mech fabricator, and you were able to duplicate any obj in the server. as a nice bonus you could also abuse the part-description-function to identify any atom in the server memory for even easier access to other yet unknown exploits of this kind. and also range check was missing to make sure you are not on some other z level massproducing guns. i will not go into details, as it is exactly the same kind of exploit over and over, so if you are interested on how and why these exploits work, see some of my other exploit commits : https://github.com/tgstation/-tg-station/pull/3416 https://github.com/Baystation12/Baystation12/pull/5068 i advise any coder team to be supercautious when changing/writing new Topic procs to prevent these, and to always doublecheck other coder's works.

 Optimizes the lockdown loops. Since all doors are now in the portals list, it can now efficiently be searched by the for loop, and subjected to only one istype() check. Furthermore, since all doors have an open and close proc, there is no need to separate firelocks and blast doors. This has the added bonus of making the lockdown somewhat harder to notice.

 Merge branch 'admin-verb-fix-air' into 'nextversion' Adds new admin verb "Fix Air" to every simulated turf. Utah's suggestion. Any simulated turf can be right clicked which will prompt the user to specify a range. That range will have its air contents replaced with "normal" air. Primary usage is to reverse effects of a griefing user. Also very useful to get rid of "stuck" plasma after killing air. This was badly needed several times since I made it, and the only downside of it is messing up the atmos tanks if used there. I guess admins will have to be told to use it carefully around atmos.

 Merge pull request #3662 from Ikarrus/212iskill Viciously murders 2.1.2
 Replaces the serviceborg beer bottle with a drinking glass, adds beer to the shaker. Emagging unlocks a second shaker with a different icon and description (but the same name) which dispenses beer2 (the disguise chloral) or mutagen or thermite. MUTAGEN might be controversial I assume... The service borg has no spray bottle though. Moves update_robot_modules_display() to fix a UI glitch where using the home to unequip a module wasn't making the module appear in the storage list until it was otherwise updated. Robots no longer take fire damage from fire stacks, since they're otherwise immune to heat... also, fire stacks will gradually burn off and the borg will stop being on fire. Service borg emag beer (beer2) was oldchloral instead of newchloral. Excellent argument against copy-paste. Fixed. Removed the dumb "if this happened to be a borg's drink container, refill whatever it's currently holding the most of after a delay" which lead to an easy reagent duplication glitch, and was generally shit. Fixes issue #1673. Uncapitalized some drink names which weren't proper nouns, and changed stuff like "Beer glass" to "glass of beer". This still fixes #3401 too of course
 -Added an auxiliary storage compartment in SSUs to store one item -Moved CE's magboots and captain's jetpack into them -Updated it so that any mob can be placed inside the SSU now. Including Corgis.

 Changes instances of "usr" to "src" Just doing a minor cleanup.
 Makes trays a subclass of bag. This somewhat changes how items are placed on them, but for the better as it's more consistent with existing mechanics. Hitting someone with the tray still scatters the contents around! Works on nonhumans. Placing icons on the tray still makes them show up on the tray. Using the tray on a table now places the items onto the table, or places the tray itself if it's empty. Robots can't lose their tray this way, I checked. Service borgs can actually use their tray to carry things! Trays can hold all sorts of stuff, as long as it's small... A service borg can carry the nuke disk around. The pinpointer does follow it correctly. If the service borg stashes its tray module, dies, explodes, gibselfs, or is forced to stash its modules by damage, it drops all the tray's contents on the ground. Fixes #236 (service borgs can't use trays) and #2991 (Items on food trays can't be picked up). Didn't address #1919, the layer issue. Fixes the "bajillion lines changed" with the maps.

 Change examine() from an atom verb to a mob verb Just in time for the feature freeze, a big change that will introduce bugs! Yay! Mob verb is called verb/examinate(target), which just calls target.examine(user) and face_atom(target) For explanation why, see http://www.byond.com/forum/?post=1326139&page=2#comment8198716 Long story short, mob verbs are much faster than object verbs. The goal is to make right-click menus populate faster. Also changes a bunch of examine() procs to always, ALWAYS call the parent. Except mobs, but you have 1 guess why I'm not touching them. Mostly this affects obj/item/examine(). And also remove a whole shitload of pointless set src in view(2) kind of crap. Also span classes.
 Fix for them having a frozen face upon death

 Removes the unused large tubes and fire bulbs. Made light bulbs have 4 brightness and tubes 8 by default, no random variables changing this value.
 adds a weakened check for canUseTopic() of borgs
 Creates canUseTopic(), a mob proc contained for the moment in the machinery.dm The Topic() proc of machinery will use this. The first non-machinery item to use this will be the violin and piano. There are plans to make admin observers use this, to make AIs don't be able to use Topic() when they lose power (doing that currently will break gameplay) and make all items use the canUseTopic() proc if needed. I just wanted to pull the fix for the piano and violin quick, the rest is a todo.

With this change the charger isn't left on, charging nothing, and even if the explosion destroys the charger the MMI is still dropped (as normal for blown, non-emagged borgs).

 Trying to fix compilation error. Changed "M as mob" in arguments list to "mob/M"; I think the former made it look for proc/can_equip() instead of mob/proc/can_equip(). Also, it no longer returns 0 for a null slot parameter.
 Even more refactoring.

 A little tweak
 Changes to the Sun : * Changed the way the sun was orbiting around the station (or is it the other way around ?), based on real time rather than an inaccurate ticks counter. * The sun can now be up to twice as fast or slow as standard rotation (1h) * The sun start with a random angle to the station at round start * The sun can rotate clockwise or counter-clockwise Changes to Solars : * The panels calculate the shortest rotation to get from their position to another. That also fixed the bug where the panel would backtrack all the way when finished a full rotation (e.g 355° to 1°) * The exposition to the sun of a panel is now correctly calculated (fixed the bug, where if the sun was, for example, at 1° and the panel at 359°, no light would arrives to the panel) * Corrected the timers for the timed rotation. * Panels made with reinforced glass now have the double of health
 Merge pull request #3411 from GunHog/TatorTry Gives the CE Advanced magboots for traitors to steal, and lets Sci make normal magboots![MAP]
 Added monkey/can_equip proc. See, isn't that much nicer?
 Quick fix on can_equip. I realized I forgot about the warning messages.
 Made human-specific can_equip proc. This code is still a mess, but it probably can't be helped short of rewriting inventory code with standardized slot numbers and such.
 Added can_equip proc for polymorphism.
 Cut out snowflake mob_can_equip code. Now it calls mob/proc/can_equip(obj/item/I, slot, disable_warning = 0) instead. Good-riddance, nasty ugly if(istype(...))! Future task: update corgi/xeno/whatever code to use this proc, now that it's nice and clean.
 huge update Makes the announcer better in every aspect (less bugs, less fun, more merging announcement capability)! Also makes it require *just* .Net 4.0 instead of 4.5. Adds the option for players to disable the PR announcements.

 Fixes cyborgs spawning as ghosts.
 * Added an option to initialize a newly build atmos computer to either monitoring distribution loop or the tanks. Atmos computer are now reconstructible and usable. * Make the atmos computers dialog auto-refresh so you can keep track of the data evolution (pressure rising, gaz mixture changing, etc) * Formatted the dialog output for better readability * Make the alert computer refresh when clearing an alert and updated the action text to tell what (area) alert was cleared (#3210).
 Fixes a critical exploit. While browsing through my server's code looking for possible exploits to fix, i noticed the following : The autolathe can be used to duplicate any and all objs. The faulty code accepts any refID from the usr without a safetycheck to see if the requested obj is in the autolathe_recipes list. This works "only" on objs because it will trigger a runtime error if the object has no material vars. The default buildcost values for obj are zero, so it always goes through the materials-check, but it would not be sufficient to plug this exploit at this point. The trivial fix is to have a check to see if the given refID is in the autolathe_recipes list, although a datum-based construction method would probably be more robust. As basically identical autolathe code appears to be used in Baycode , /tg/, /vg/, Para, and all other builds i could look at, i assumed this exploit has been undetected since Goon. And indeed, the faulty code is present in Gooncode rev4407 and has been ever since.

 Second attempt using the map merger
 Mineral Storage Access Mineral Storage gives you access to the ore redemption machine, instead of keeping a list of req_one_access for various jobs. The intention is to make it easier to manage accesses and make it more clear who could use the machine. Miners and their superiors now have access to the machine. If this becomes an issue I can adjust it. Relabeled Mineral Storeroom access to Mineral Storage since the storeroom doesn't exist any more.
 Electronics will now remember if the airlock it was taken from was using req_one_access
 Updated the godawful Airlock Electronics interface Also added the ability to set if the door should require ALL listed accesses, or just one.

 If you try to use the teleporter and the teleport was rejected for any reason (like having a nuclear disk), you won't get the chance to get a random damage from the teleport. Fixes issue #2236. Removed some spawn() calls. Removed the chance of fail from the portal effects (the blue portals made with hand teleporters). The portal datums will now return 0 if the teleport failed, and now use a new proc, start(), instead of New() to handle themselves. Standarized teleport.dm from the helper_datums folder. Removed the checks for centcomm z level and away missions z level for teleports. Now you can go there. changed the /red messages from the teleports datum to span classes. The "[something] bounces off of the portal!" were replaced for "The portal rejects [something]". Removed an extra "the" on those messages.
 Made the teleporters (the one with the computer, power station and portal) link eachother at roundstart with initialize(). And also at New() because why not.
 Added back the dermal patch to the HoS locker. For some reason this item keeps getting stealth changes lately.

Replaced the other syndicate suit in the derelict with the red/black version. Added a red/black space suit to the abandoned mining station, inside the resin corridor, along with a syndicate toolbox.

 AI Photography Extention #2 Gives the ability to take and view photo to Cyborgs AI's share their photo album with connected Cyborgs, and connected Cyborgs have the pictures they take saved to the AI's album. If a Cyborg is not connected to an AI, photos are saved to the Cyborg's camera object. If a Cyborg has photos in it's album while not connected to an AI, but is subsequently connected to an AI, the photos are added to the AI's album. This is initiated by pulsing the appropriate wire on the borg. Cyborgs can attach images to newscaster feeds, from the active album available to it (the AI's, or its own if disconnected) Cyborgs cannot interact with photocopiers, but however have become a moving printer. They are every inefficent at printing, and thus can only print two color pictures before needing to be refilled with toner (simply click on them with toner in active hand). Added some span classes to the previous AI photography work. One minor bug fix to photocopier which could result in a photo object ending up in the 'hand' of an AI or cyborg.

 Small rewrite of crematorium and morgue so they work right. Only issue is that the damn things don't GC. Also lots of duplicate code between the two, still some other shittiness, but this is much better. I really just wanted to fix the bug where after usage you can't use em again until the tray gets deleted rather than GC'd. On the plus side, they don't constantly make and delete trays every time someone opens them. Also, and this is important, I uncommented the crematorium usage logging. It didn't runtime in testing so it should be good to go.

 Fix some blob-related qdel() issues. In particular, the one where dead blob spores make a shitload of smoke and become invisible and generally be buggy on death. Also blobs should GC correctly now.
 Modified qdel() to accept any datum. The garbage controller no longer bothers nulling out every variable on destroyed objects. An object can opt to not be collected by returning true from Destroy(). Useful for pools or other edge cases. Fixed boxes not being collected, along with a couple other things. Turfs will not be monitored for collection. generate_ion_law() is no longer a /datum proc, and I am an admin in the repo. Deal with it.

 That computer is horrendous Still doesn't work properly for AI. Probably never will.
 Changed the admin Traitor Panel command to make someone a cultist use the ticker proc - because its previous snowflake nature I wasted an hour wondering why something wasnt working.... bah Tidied the supplypacks up for consistant names and to avoid The Bureaucracy crate etc. Created an Innate Communication verb thats given to the cultists when converted and removed when deconverted. It possibly works with constructs but cant really test because the make constructs procs are all kinds of messed up. Anyway - they'll tear at their arms, smear blood on the floor, and communicate as normal per the rune. Its pretty rudimentry right now and could be improved in a few ways - see the comments. Added a link to open the Read Tome window on the Notes page as apparently alert() is limited to a whopping three choices. Added a built in communication system for the tomes, it works pretty much like the current communicate rune. Fixed a load of fucked up tabbing in ritual.dm, I don't know who to blame but I'm betting it was sadbutt.

 Updated Changelog Added a changelog entry for overridden machines no longer attacking loyal Cyborgs.
 Rewrote how emags work on doors Intended to allow the deconstruction and replacement of the doors without needing an RCD. Emagged doors will be unusable for at least 60 seconds, so weld+emagging still works. It's just not permanent. Using an emag on a door will: -Try to open the door -Cut power for 60 seconds -Drop bolts -Cut bolt lights -Effectively make the door unusable for at least a minute Doors that have been emagged: -Can only be opened with a crowbar or axe if the power is off and the bolts are up -Can be hacked as normal, except the Open wire will not work -Cannot be interfaced by silicons at all -No longer prevent players from using tools (Can we unwelded, wires cut, etc) -Can be deconstructed and repaired Misc: Also made it so you can bump open doors even if the panel is open. So people can't go around opening all the panels and making the doors really annoying to open.
 Ian wearing the HoP Cap. The most important update. Also removes a rogue pixel in the human HoP cap sprite.
 -Fixed overlay issues with a couple of doortypes due to different speeds in their opening animation. -elights no longer blink while a door is bolted, mostly to prevent overlap of colors
 Doors now have their own unique animation for their emergency lights I also removed door1.dmi as it was unused and just had duplicate icons found in other files.
 Fixes #3084. The message will appear on mob creation and also if the player check their notes. Known thing I can't do anything about: There's no good way to selectively delete memories which may or may not exist on a mob. Someone who gets turned into a lot of ventcrawling mobs (a ling who likes lesser forming, a player slime reproducing) will continue to accrue a new message with each new incarnation. Considering we log multiple times of death in the same fashion I'm calling non-issue.

 Changelog for Sec alterations
 Shuttles changing location will update the area's has_gravity.
 Closes the span class on the airlock maintenance panel feedback message and added proper punctuation to it.
 Cultists start with sacrifice and convert Made sacrifice trap the victims soul in a shard (credit to @adrix89 - although with how long it took to fix the compile times from porting the code I probably wouldve been better starting afresh) Changed convert to require three cultists
 Inverted the blinking animation to reduce the flickering while the door closes and opens
 Added a feedback message for when a player opens or closes the maint panel of an airlock.
 Emergency Access Override Update -Changed the way emergency access override is handled. It now toggles a var which overrides access requirements instead of removing/adding access -Airlocks now have blinking amber lights when in emergency mode -AIs can toggle emergency override on individual doors -Humans may disable emergency overrides by pulsing the ID scanner wire. They can't enable it, since IMO there are enough methods to hack open doors without an easymode all-access wire
 Human overlays will show themselves again.
 atom/movable
 Typo fixes. I'm keeping the comma-less but.
 * Gave the supply area gravity. * Removed a misplaced object on the map.
 Added a new gravity generator which will produce gravity for the station. Sprites by Ausop, which he posted in his sprite thread. The gravity generator is very sturdy, as it is almost indestructible, but explosions can break it and it will need repairs. Changed C4 to stop del()'ing and instead will only use ex_act(). Added an interact_offline variable for machines that will allow you to interact with them even if they are depowered. The gravity generator only uses this at the moment. Removed the stun that people get when gravity changes. Shuttles have gravity still. Added a gravity generator room to the west of Engineering. It is very secure, with a foyer and requiring CE or Captain access. There are instructions on the table for repairing and enabling/disabling the machine.
 Required players increased by 5 to 20 Starting cultists increased to 9 Convert no longer gives words

 Standardizes and expands the warning() and error() procs.
 mkay, Giacom's solution seems more elegant, dropping the faction-related changes now this is only a feedback message-related PR.
 Changed overriden machines so that they do not attack cyborgs that aren't synced to the AI. Overriden machines are their own subtype now. Did not use the faction variable as that can be unreliable as neutral hostile mobs will attack any other mob without the neutral faction flag.
 Makes Machine Overridden machines no longer attack borgs Adds a 'silicon' faction, all AIs, borgs and machine overridden machines are in this faction. Also adds some feedback text to malf powers, gives span classes to some already existing feedback messages. Fixes a few typos and errors in descriptions. /red is not welcome, removed.

 Magic Mania 1.5: Big Trouble in Little Boxstation --- A Few New Wizard Items Staff of Chaos: Shoots random magic bolts. Charges faster and can hold more shots than other staves. Staff of Door Creation: Works the same as the wand of door creation. There is apparently demand for this! Charges faster and can hold more shots than other staves. Wand Assortment: A belt that comes of one of each useful wand, generated with the highest number of shots possible. --- Cleaning Up the Spellbook The spellbook was getting REALLY long, so it's been segmented into pages for spells, items, and one time use spells (aka the fun page). The spellbook also highlights the fact that you can upgrade spells better now. --- Summon Magic Rebalancing There's now a new catagory of magic items that are especially potent. These have a very low chance of showing up now and only one can spawn during a casting of summon magic, if one even spawns at all. The person who gets it is not guarenteed to be a surivor either. In this category: Staff of Animation, Staff of Change, Staff of Chaos, Wand Assortment, Contract of Apprenticeship. Additionally the staff of door creation is now in the normal pool and the staff of change is no longer in the normal pool. --- Misc Stuff Adds Bats and Goats to the staff of change. Changes the charge spell so if you charge something that can charge on its own there's no chance of degradation.

 APC overlay bugfix. Before: If you turned off the breaker and fiddled with on/off states and turned on the breaker it wouldn't update the overlay because the check_updates wasn't doing an if(operating) check and would think it didn't need to update the overlays once you turned on the breaker.

 Adds a Dissonant Shriek power for changelings that causes an EMP.
 - Changes changeling abilities from verbs to proc_holder objects. - Functionality should be unchanged - Admins can varedit chemical costs of individual abilities. - Allows coders to implement sting upgrades more easily.

 Staff of animated statue fixes and nerfs Player controlled animated statues that ghost won't start attacking everyone, they'll just stalk people without attacking. A player controlled animated statue will only last as long as the statue would have lasted,at the end of the time the player is released from the statue as usual, and no longer has any onus to not fuck up the wizard. NOTE: this means you can't use animate statues to "kill" a target, they'll recover eventually, and even if the round ends before they do, it still won't count.
 Added trays
 Item sprites! Adds generic item sprites to all items added.
 Makes fancy items obtainable. Adds a formal-wear crate, makes lawyers have laceup shoes, adds a better sprite for the memorizer, adds the formal uniforms to each job's closet, and fixes a typo in the object name of the black jacket. [FORMALNESS INTENSIFIES]

 Making compilable
 Fixes bullet_act not checking for damagetype on many, many objects. Replaces Holodamage with Stamina damage, if your stamina damage exceeds your current health, you get weaken(5)'d. Stamina heals itself slowly over time. Makes the hallucination enemies deal more stamina damage than they did holodamage, but stamina damage heals now so it's mostly for just seeming threatening at the moment. Adds the Disabler, a gun that does stamina damage. It has a range of your screen, but no more. Adds a disabler crate to cargo (security lock) Fixes Lasertag ED209's because they were busted as shit Reduces ED209's view range to 9 from 12, which was several times longer than your screen view, now is only a little bit more Lastertag now does stamina damage instead of an instant stun for that GRITTY LASERTAG EXPERIENCE

 modifies how far a corpse is from a blob for zombies to occur. Initially it was bugged to be anywhere in the same area Then it was only the tile under the blob Now, thanks to standing corpses and rally spores not always rallying a spore to the exact place you click, it's the same tile or one tile adjacent.

 Made gibbing not look stupid. Also some basic stuff in an attempt to get complex mobs to GC. Still doesn't work atm.
 If a hand teleporter portal is forced to spawn on top of you (meaning you're completely encased in impassible material) you will automatically teleport with it.

 Removes the ventcrawl verb, all ventcrawlers are still ventcrawlers and can use ventcrawling with the alt click. This is simutaniously less buggy and far easier to do on the fly. The meat of ventcrawling is now stored in the vent pump, meaning anything can ventcrawl if it has ventcrawling on. Ventcrawling 0 is no crawling, Ventcrawling 1 is naked crawling, Ventcrawling 2 and above is always crawling. Yes you can var edit humans to be able to ventcrawl with this, great if you want to reenact diehard! Simple animals that logically should fit in a vent can now ventcrawl. Note that this only is relevent for player controlled simple animals (staff of change/badminry), it won't be used by the mob AI.

 Standardizes Golem Funbags, both adamantine and normal. Whoever originally did these sprites didn't use the female base to make them, so the breats were oversized compared to the other races, meaning they'd clip like hell through clothing/underwear. The problem has been fixed.

 Make items equipped by mobs unequip themselves as part of Destroy() Change the GC's loops to for() loops instead of while() loops. Also fixed a really stupid mistake where it would cut random shit out of the destroyed list instead of what was just processed. Made it use world.time instead of world.timeofday to get rid of stupid midnight rollover errors. Also there's a split between caps on var clearing and deletion checks Moved the invisibility = 101 bit out of the GC and into atom/Destroy()
 Nuke Ops Group Shaming
 Fixes Golems not being able to use internals with their own face. What had happened was when ABSTRACT was introduced the golem face got its own flags, and lost the flags it usually gained from inheritance that it needed to be used as internals (MASKINTERNALS and MASKCOVERSMOUTH). It now has all the flags it used to have. Also, for no reason, it was defined twice in the exact same manner in a row.

 By sticking a crayon in the mix when making a burger you can now make a colored burger! Standardizes burger code to end the madness of there being like 30 different burgers that have the same damn thing in them.
 First pass at a qdel() garbage collection system for tgstation Works pretty well. If it can't GC something, it'll just del() it and be done. Speed is amazing, holy shit. New procs you should be aware of: qdel(atom/movable) - sets up an object for garbage collection. Call this rather than del(atom/movable). atom/movable/Destroy() - called right before the object is GC'd, so it still has a loc. Also called if the object is del()'d. new controller - garbage.dm has all the details on this. Basically it nulls all references on GC'd objects and force del() them if necessary. Generally speaking, objects should use Destroy() for behavior prior to deletion rather than Del(). You should also always call the parent so the object gets the right gc_destroyed var set. ISSUES: Tries to GC mobs atm. This actually works for new players, not so much for humans/monkies/simple_animals/anything. I'm guessing it needs to clear out their mind and HUD and maybe other things. Gibbing is really bugged. It works, but the overlays just sit there for awhile and ugh. I'm very tempted just to del() mob/living and mob/camera and call it a day. qdel() equipment doesn't unequip the item. Pipes don't generally GC correctly. Debugging suggests they get referenced in many pipenets and that isn't cleared properly. However some do work fine. Need assistance here. Bots don't GC, probably in the radio controller. Lots of other shit doesn't GC but it's hard to find them because of the pipe spam. I think I'm calling Destroy() twice by accident.

 Nerfed EMP's against augmented limbs Because there's not much benefit to only having a few limbs augmented, and 120/60 damage just silly. For comparison, cyborgs take 20 damage total from an EMP and 5-10 stun, and humans take 60 brute damage for being just outside the gibbing range of a bomb. This PR brings the average damage from a strong EMP to an aug down to 48, and from a weak EMP down to 30. The stun against a full aug is still very likely to be around 10 or 5, respectively. This is on top of having weapons drained, headsets disabled, etc.

 Adds a small Mineral Storeroom off the R&D lab so the redemption machine isn't just in a open hallway where anyone can run up and steal your minerals/ID. Room is simple to break into as the machine will always dump the minerals inside, even if they were commanded to dump by one of the odd departments with access to the machine who aren't science. Frustrated employees are instructed to ask R&D to fetch the minerals and/or break in. It's also a fairly weak point into Science proper. The window connecting R&D to the mineral storeroom isn't tinted so scientists can see mineral drop offs. Pressing the shutters for the front desk will now also shutter that window so they can maintain their old privacy.

 Renames the "freedom" bundle the "implant" bundle cause that's what it is, man. The freedom implant is now shrugs only, and the emp implant can now not be shrugs. The freedom implant now has an assured 4 uses instead of rand 1 to 5 because... why? Adds an explosive implant to the bundle, and labels it since there's a good chance the traitor would rather use it on someone else instead of themselves. No F U C K S given.

 Monkey attack messages now use span class
 Blobize edge case fix Fixes an edge case for blobize where if you open someone's player panel and they ghost between then and when you hit the blobize button it still gives priority to them for the created blob. Note that you can't usually get the option to blobize a player if they've left their body before you open the player panel, if you want to blobize a specific person in this way, ask for them to return to their body.

 Fixes #1006 the invisible UI object bug This isn't a good fix, but the real fix would require massive changes to human/update_icons.dm. NOPE.avi. If you're feeling antsy, PM me. To reproduce the problem every round, in mob.dm change update_icon = 1 to 0.

 Removed the lonestanding half hidden R-wall that survived the medbay r-wall reckoning. Rest in peace my nonsensical friend.
 [Map] Farewell to sleeper consoles The now useless and misleading sleeper consoles have been removed from the premise. Additionally the sleeper area has been downsized slightly as a result of the loss of the consoles, making more room in cryo in the event that enterprising crewmembers want to create a third tube.

 Animate statues in magic stuff/Staff of Change rebalance Adds animate statues to the Staff of Change pool of mobs Adds specific synergy between flesh to stone and the staff of animation where if you animate your statue'd people they'll turn to animated statues controlled by the victim who are instructed not to dunk the wizard. Splits the "animal" sub pool in the Staff of Change into "Beast" and "Helpless Animals" to help raise the odds of the former against the latter. Changed odds will be reported in a comment to follow.

 Merge pull request #1 from tgstation/master Back to work
 Makes my solution to "the blob needs to be over the corpse to make the zombie!" a bit more basic and less prone to fuck ups. It was bugging out. Also fixes a tiny oversight that left a hole in the nurses outfit ever since female outfit generation was put in. The fact that no studdering erp nurses complained should tell you about their near mythical nature.
 Just some general polishing for the statue mobs. Statue mobs can't change their direction while seen. Lowered the range for flickering lights. Lowered the cooldown for blinding people, added user feedback when the spell is used. The blindness spell will affect people within objects.

 Removes slipping in space Added a standing check before damage is applied by lube. Aliens and hulks won't take damage for sliding on lube.
 Nitpicked 2433 fix
 Removes falling in space You can still be stunned, slip (unfortunately), be pushed or die, your icon just remains upright to simulate zero gravity. Upon being dragged into the station, your body thumps to the ground inside the airlock. It's pretty neat.
 Reverted the accidental tick for ministation.dm
 The statue will call dust() when gibbed. Increased the range of blind() so mobs just outside his can_be_seen() check won't stop it from blinding them. Added a client check for AI stuff.

 Removes the RNG spell loss from mindswap. Had a plan for a stealthy wizard round using mindswap? Whoops looks like you just lost knock because fuck you. It was well coded but people don't use mindswap enough to warrent a threat of permacrippling on use. To the creator's credit was very easy to take out.

 Adds a new statue hostile mob! This hostile mob is very much like other monsters that move/kill you when you don't look at them. This mob is also designed to be player controlled and has spells to get around the 360 vision problem, such as flickering lights and causing people around it to go blind for a short duration. CANPUSH is now used by simple_animals Added 4 directional sprites for the statue.

 Fixes #2603: Bodyfall thuds in cryo and cloning All carbon mobs have fall sounds now. Fall sounds are now called by the turf the faller is on, not the faller themselves. Thank you Razharas for generously helping me with this.
 Emergency fix for a projectile runtime Emitters (and probably turrets) never clicked anything so this var is null. Starting the singulo = emitter shots never move and runtime constantly.
 fixes resin doors
 Inserting lights into containers should no longer dim other lights.
 Fixes runtime with seed extractor Also removes unnecessary drop proc call on bluespace tomatoes, throwing them updates the hand icon.
 Refactored Close() and Open()
 Fixes #2396 and #2395 - Banana peels are now grown weapons - Banana peel slip duration is now based on their potency - Clown spawns with a 50 potency banana, which is both regular sized and produces a skin that's nice and slippery~ - Fixes nettle and deathnettle inhands not disappearing upon use - Makes nettle and deathnettles use the hitsound variable instead of the playsound proc directly. Now their hitsounds will scale in volume based on damage done. - Makes the banana mortar shoot potency 65 banana peels. Because otherwise it'd shoot laughably tiny and short in slip duration potency -1 ones. - Moves corncobs to be grown weapons and updates their paths. Now their size will scale based on the size of the corn that spawned them. - Updates banan paths :)

 Merge pull request #2380 from Aranclanos/MineralDoors Mineral doors, small fixes.
 Adds a chance of syndiborg to the staff of change. Odds of syndiborg are 5%, odds of normal borg are now 11.666...%, down from 16.666...% syndiborgs spawn with their default lawset, which means that they can (and almost certainly will) try to kill everyone if left to their own devices
 Adds a new game option: slow_game_type_odds If it's on on the server revision screen below the preexisting information there will be a readout showing the raw chance of each round type occuring. This doesn't tell anyone what the current round type is, it just shows what the odds are. It defaults to off
 MiniStation Update Fixes a runtime with the vent clogging event, which happens to MiniStation. Lowered all vent requirements to 20. Fixed transit tubes from breaking by reversing the pod direction twice. Changed the icon state name of the terminators so that they had density. Transit tubes will now reset the view of the mob exiting.

 Fixes rollerbeds and their offsets so they don't look stupid.
 Fixes #2553 and #2533 Fixes the away map dead slime spawner. Previously, it would spawn two dead slimes that had living icons. Now it spawns one slime with a dead icon. These issues are fixed by adding a check for existing slimes at the spawner's location before spawning a slime, and killing the spawned slime via adjustToxLoss() instead of death(). Death() doesn't give the slime a dead icon for some reason. Fixes the away map dead AI spawner. Previously, it spawned a dead AI that showed on the PDA messenger from roundstart, made the AI status displays on the station show the BSoD, and displayed its laws in the round-end report. These issues are fixed by setting the spawned AI's PDA toggle to 1, changing the status displays back to blank after the AI dies and removing the dead AI from the moblist so it isn't shown at the end of the game.
 Makes slimes no longer lie down.
 Added more signs and different styles of floor tiles to the map.
 Updates box2550away - Anchors all computer frames - Adds survivor Ian (he didn't exist back then but the map is already full of anachronisms). Adds snack wrappers to HoP office in an attempt to explain his survival. I think players will like the idea of Ian outliving the dead old characters on the map. - Breaks all food and drink machines and adds an Out of Order paper floating on them suggesting the reader goes back to the station if they're hungry or thirsty. - Removes detective's security camera TV because it doesn't work off-station and there aren't cameras anyway. - Removes dead AI and dead slime as both had issues. - Fixes beer keg and cola incorrect object paths. - Fixes AI module incorrect object paths. - Removes all but one SWAT body armour from the armoury. Removes two of the SWAT helmets. - Emags the maintenance door to and from the portal so those without maintenance can enter and exit the portal room.
 Stops the whitescreen of death some users were having. Also "readds" the red-damage-bloody-screen-so-real. I'll get a screenshot in a bit. Source of the bug: I changed the red screen to use BLEND_MULTIPLY. Due to a mistake I made, the white part in the middle was fully opaque, but since it was a multiply blend, that didn't matter. Turns out in software mode, MULTIPLY defaults to OVERLAY or something, so users in software mode were seeing a fully opaque, non-blended white screen rather than a slightly red tint. Nasty. Also multiply was stupid. The red was barely noticeable in many cases. Against black like space or things you couldn't see, the red literally didn't even display. No idea why I was so insistent on using this. Solution: Instead I'll use BLEND_ADD which works just fine in software mode. However, ADD can't add blackness, so I have to have a second layer of darkness on the edges. Also I made the red on the so real blood screen brighter and more intense because it looked kind of dumb. This will probably need to be toned down or even reverted but that's ok.
 Fixes a possible runtime with gibtonite deposits.
 Fixes turret construction so that you can actually build types other than taser turrets, also makes it so that lasertag turrets don't stun their own team.
 Fixes Cat Crates, Corgi Crates and Chick crates. File bug reports you guys, seriously.
 Stops the admins from getting spammed from gibtonite, but is still logged
 Walking mushrooms will now hunt and eat eachother, growing stronger when they do! The stronger they get, the better the quality of the mushroom slices you can butcher out of them! Don't smack em yourself though, or you'll bruise them, and they won't get stronger from being eaten.
 Adding a missing file.
 Ported the MiniStation branch. MiniStation is now a single folder which isn't included by default. When you tick the code file for the ministation map, like with tgstation and metastation, it will then include the necessary code files itself. These code files modify certain datums, like jobs, supply packs and uplink datums. The modified files outside the MiniStation folder are modifications made by the MiniStation branch which aren't changes exclusive to MiniStation. Such as changing the unused circulator, which only MiniStation used, so that it was fixed and would correctly match the direction of the thermal generator. The TEG was also changed to have a better interface and to include the above fix. The department security was changed so it wouldn't runtime if it didn't find a checkpoint. The preferences' SetChoices was changed so that the screen would automatically grow for every column in the job list. The main difference between this version and the forked version is that the Unemployed and the Lieutenant was reverted back to their original names; since it would've been a massive pain to add support for that.
 Gets rid of a couple colons.

 Attack sounds for all melee weapons Weapons that do no damage play a tap sound, except for the bike horn and banhammer. Adds a different attack message for forceless attacks. It says tapped or patted on instead of attacked in. Adds force zero check to armour before attempting to block attacks. Adds hitsounds to the welder, lighter, matches, cigarettes, energy sword and energy axe for when they're on and off. Adds 5 force to the lighter when it's lit. Same as when you accidentally burn yourself lighting it. Adds a hitsound and the correct damage type to the lighter. Adds hitsound volume scaling based on the weapon's force and its weight class. Adds tap sound scaling based on a weapon's weight class. Removes boldness from item attack messages on non-human mobs. The attack is still bolded for the player controlling the mob. Adds a force check to blood spurts when attacking non-human mobs. If the weapon doesn't have a force, no blood will come out. Adds adminhelp.ogg as the banhammer's hitsound with Cheridan's permission. Adds a much needed period to the catatonic human examine message. Makes the activation and deactivation sounds of toy swords, energy swords and energy shields quieter. What an earsore. Makes description, item_state and name of matches that have burned out on their own consistent with those put out by the player. Changes match, cigarette and lighter attack verbs and forces based on whether they're lit or not. Fixes a bug that allowed players to light cigarettes with burnt matches. Names lit cigarettes and children of cigarettes lit [name]. Fixes a bug with the energy blade that kept it at weight class 5 after it was deactivated. Changes the welder out of fuel message slightly to be less fragmented. Removes dead air from most of the weapon sound effects used in this pull to make them more responsive. In other words, the fire extinguisher sound will play a lot sooner after you click than before. Equalised their peak volumes to all be -0.1dB and in an attempt to make altering volumes based on force more consistent. Thank you @YotaXP for help with the item_attack.dm attack messages. Thank you @optimumtact for help with code for testing item_attack volumes. Thank you @Giacom for help with the code for scaling hitsound and tap sound volume by hitforce.

 Removes the "SmoothOperator" bundle for being dreadful compared to the other bundles Bundle included Stetchkin (TC ???): the gun we gave nuke ops to tell them they had to buy their own guns now. Has nonrefillable ammo. A silencer (TC 2): makes the gun a normal item (one of its only pluses was it was a small item). Syndie Soap (TC 1): slips forever. A Trash Bag (TC 0): It's a bulky item so once you take it out of the box you're stuck explaining to everyone why you're carrying a trashbag as not a janitor. A Body Bag (TC 0): Obtensibly to drag off corpses without leaving a mess... but then why do they get the soap? A Suit (TC 0): Availible for free in the locker room closet Lace Up Shoes (TC 0): "Shoot me, I'm valid!" Since you can't buy a Stetchkin I can't give it an absolute value, except to say that it's worse in almost every respect to the revolver. which is 6. Even if you are VERY charitable and give it the full 6 valuationyou still have a bundle that awards you less than 10TC of items where every other bundle awards you more than 10TC (that's the point of taking a bundle). http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiMOKmp0uZc

 Blob Zombies! Blob spores that pass over the dead will now couple with the corpses to create blob zombies that are stronger and more resiliant than the spore alone. Should the blob zombie fall the original corpse is recovered and just as cloneable as it was before infection. These are simple animals not under the control of anyone. Blob zombies will occur automatically if a blob finds a corpse under it and it's not already a zombie. Blob zombies have a base 80 health (normal blobs have 40) and gain additional health if the host body is wearing armor. They don't however actually gain the normal benefits of wearing the armor. Blob zombies attack for 10 to 15 damage per strike, as opposed to the paltry 2 to 4 a hostless spore does. Why this is good for the overmind: The overmind cannot directly command the creation of zombies but can rally spores to a corpse's location to largely assure it will happen by itself. Blob zombies still follow rally spore commands and still count towards a factory blobs spore limit. As previously shown they're far more robust than spores and also deny the crew the ability to clone the victim until the zombie is defeated. Why this is good for the crew: Remember when the warden kamakazied the blob at the start of the round only to be engulfed and killed with the entire armory in his backpack? You can get those guns back now, because the warden's corpse will soon be moving to a very recoverable location! This also promotes not letting people die pointlessly to the blob or at least dragging corpses away from the blob (and hopefully to genetics) so they can't be infected.

 Added the SetEmagged proc, for cyborgs, and replaced code to use it. Added get_inactive_modules and get_usable_modules procs to use while looping through the cyborg's modules. The cyborg's storage screen will now shrink if there is an empty row. Added a new on_emag proc for modules, which is called when the module is emagged. Miner borgs use it to replace their borg drill for a diamond one. Fixes a runtime where there is no client to update the hud. Fixes a bug where if you emag a cyborg with no module and when they choose a miner they do not receive their diamond drill.
 You can now properly clean your hands of blood. Fixes #2258. When you touch an item, to spread the blood, it would take the "bloody_hands" to 0; which is checked if true while you wash your hands. I limited it to only go down to 1, so it will still be true unless you wash your hands. Fixed an issue where blood_DNA was being cleared before the blood_hands variable was being set to 0. Now you can properly hide your bloody hands with gloves and when you take them off the hands will still be bloody. Removed an unused variable. Set the bloody_hands_mob to null where it was appropriate. The amount of blood you can transfer to other items, when you touch them, will be a little random for variety. Revive() will now heal your hallos damage.

 Reagents can now mix their alpha color. Changed water to a grey very transparent colour, so real. This also means when you water down reagents you can see them becoming very transparent, extra real! Changed the plasma reagent's colour to look a little better. Changed the icon of the reagent filling overlays so that they didn't mess up the colours so much.

 * Removed the icon operations from the kitty ears by removing their changing colour gimmick. * Removed hacky checks for the item.
 Changed the base colour sprite for the chempuff.dmi Fixed a typo.
 Refactored the code to remove most icon operations for changing an icon's colour. I had to manually set all the icons, which are subject to colour change, to be have a white/grey icon, so that the colours added properly, and then have them coloured in the code. This means the icons for runes, the reagent beaker overlay, smoke and etc will all be white. They now all use the new 500+ color variable. The only noticeable gameplay difference is that you can't choose your graffiti's shade.

 Jenkins you're a loose cannon, but you're a damn good cop.

 Slime Mob Refactor Death of the istype invasion from slimes, previously every single color of slime was its own kind of mob, and every single one of those slimes also had an adult form which was a different mob. There is now only one kind of slime, reliant on new var is_adult and old var colour to determine how it looks. All baby slimes functioned identically outside of icon and core, and all adult slimes functioned identically to each other and to the babys save for a bit higher Health and more capacity to break shit. A nice side effect is that this solves any inheritence issues of baby slimes growing up since it's still the same mob, though it doesn't solve the same issues for adult slimes splitting. Also fixed a few annoying but rare bugs (like getting ghosted because you got DC'd and your slime self split and you weren't around to get mind transfered)
 Hopefully fixes Giacom's complaints

 Big(gish) map reorganization. Moved all main .dmm maps to _maps/map_files Each main map gets a .dm file in _maps, this is what's ticked, -NOT- the .dmm file. This allows use of a MAP_NAME define for various purposes, and lays the groundwork for map customization in the future. Also included a hacky dm.sh script which supports swapping maps. For example, "./dm.sh tgstation.dme -Mmetastation" would compile with metastation. Signed-off-by: Mloc-Argent <colmohici@gmail.com>

 Disabled the game using set background by making all instances of it use a define, which can be changed in code/_compile_options.dm Testing has revealed that it reduces the sluggishness of the game, though it will spike from lag when the singularity is loose. Thanks to ChuckTheSheep for suggesting it. Server owners who want to keep set background enabled can do so by changing the define.
 - Destroying a mindswapper's old body won't destroy the spells. - Reverts a non-fun change to silly spellcasters. - Mime's spells are bound to the mob. They do not transfer and can not be lost in mindswap.
 Emagged Cyborgs, when destroyed via the Robotics Console, will not only have a large explosion but their MMI will die with them. This will promote locking down the cyborg, instead, to discover who emagged it via cyborg deconstruction. This commit was brought to you by the feedback thread, which made it happen.

 - Moves spells from the mob to the mind. - Construct spells are an exception. - Spells are transferred whenever a mind is transferred: cloning, pod cloning, borging, staff of changing. - Spells are not transferred when you create a new mind for a new mob: soul stones, golems, respawns. - To my surprise, this did not fix the issue where a mind-swapped wizard loses their spells when their original body is destroyed. I do not know why this happens. - Non-human mobs can't use spells by default. Varedit spell.human_req to do that.

 NanoUI Update * Refactored the code used in the ui_interact procs to be neater and easy to understand (also less code duplication). Updated all existing ui_interact procs to match. * Rebuilt (and simplified) template rendering system, removed data-linking (the use of carets "^" in templates) and the need to send the full data structure every update (just send whatever you want now, it's fully dynamic). Updated all existing templates to match. * Restructured HTML and JavaScript to increase compatibility with IE (this fixes "blank uis" for many users). * Increased the number of error messages to help diagnose issues. * Multiple performance improvements, especially when updating an open ui. * Added the ability to update a ui for an individual user (nanomanager update_user_uis proc, used for things like realtime messages in Bay's PDA). * Added a "Loading..." notice to the UI. If this stays then your JavaScript isn't enabled. * Removed redundant wip apc.tmpl file. * Added a link to the online docs in TemplatesGuide.txt.

 Adds New Bomb/Bomb Cores + A BIG bomb bugfix Adds a training bomb that doesn't explode but rather lets you know it would have exploded. Upon detonation or defusal it will give you your current score and rescramble the wires for another go. It should probably be added to the map somewhere in a pull that follows this. Adds a badmin bomb that lets you summon in a number of whatever you want with var editing, it defaults to a single cookie. Adds a specially skinned badmin clown bomb that summons in a 100 clowns by default. It honks! Fixes a HUGE bug where, thanks to machinery automatically adding themselves to processing, bombs were ticking down two seconds at a time. This does mean that all bombs are now "nerfed" to twice the time it took before. Whether this is a good thing or should result in the timer going "back" to 30 seconds to keep the timing consistant is an open quesion.

 Obsoletes flags = FPRINT | TABLEPASS* *TABLEPASS was already totally obsolete. FPRINT was used, but it was on virtually everything anyway. Removes those flags from every instance where they were used. Also assigned and removed other flags where it made sense. If it is desired, I can revive the flag as NOFPRINT, which would retain the original functionality, though inverted. That way it would be be used only where it was intentional (holodeck items could use this for example).
 Merge pull request #2031 from Alek2ander/master VV permissions check update, fixes #2009
 Changes the initialism for stat collecting on summon magic to SU because SM was taken by smoke. On the stat page this will result in smoke being overreported until a full month after this change has been live on both servers. For judgement purposes you can probably assume that nearly all "smoke" spells on the stat page are actually summon magic, because who the hell takes smoke?

 Moved Speech Modification via masks to masks. say and whisper now call the speechModification(message) proc in wear_mask. Moved derpspeech modification to mob_helpers.dm
 Merges Heal_Damage and Heal_robotic_damage procs like I should have done in the first place. Corrects all usages of Heal_damage so it works with the changed version. Same goes for Heal_robotic_damage
 Changes damage overlay threshold from 10 and on to 35 and on - Changes the damage overlay thresholds so they start displaying when you are a bit more damaged than currently. There are six damage overlays, their thresholds used to be 10-25; 25-40; 40-55; 55-70; 70-85; 85-infinity. This change sets them to 35-45; 45-55; 55-65; 65-75; 75-85; 85-infinity. (The thresholds are the sum of fireloss, bruteloss and the hit indicator variable) - Oxyloss overlay left unchanged, since you pass out at 50 or something, so you need the visual cue quicker. Main reason for this proposed change is that I feel the overlays kick in too quickly. I think it'd be good to leave a little room, so you don't get an overlay as soon as the first moron boops you over the head with his crowbar.

 Adds framework for multiple UI styles for humans, with a no-UI mode being the first example. Also makes all mobs' UIs scalable. - Rewrote all UI element positions to use values that are anchored to NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST and CENTER instead of absolute numbers. Changing view range now no longer messes up the UI. Screenshots: http://www.ss13.eu/uiscaling_human.png (human) http://www.ss13.eu/uiscaling_borg.png (cyborg) http://www.ss13.eu/uiscaling_alien.png (alien) http://www.ss13.eu/uiscaling_monkey.png (monkey) - Changing the view range no longer messes up shortsightedness and welding mask dither effects Screenshots: http://www.ss13.eu/uiscaling_welding.png (welding mask) http://www.ss13.eu/uiscaling_shortsight.png (shortsightedness) - The flash overlay now covers the entire screen no matter what the view range is - The damage overlay and blindness overlay are now centered even if you change the view range. They are however images of a fixed size, so they only cover a part of the screen. This one is better than it was, but still 'imperfect'. I'm guessing we'll have to wait until we switch to byond 500 for a better solution to this. Screenshot: http://www.ss13.eu/uiscaling_dead.png (critical condition) - Pressing F12 now no longer only switches between the standard and a reduced overlay, it cycles through all available UI styles, of which there are currently three: Standard UI, reduced UI and no UI (intended for taking screenshots while alive). Note that this does not remove the blindness, damage and flash overlays, it however removes all damage indication icons (like suffocation, fire damage, etc) Screenshot: http://www.ss13.eu/uiscaling_blank.png (no UI)

 * Refactored gib() and dust() * Refactored ex_act(), for mobs, a little. * Removed the code which gibbed dead bodies with any severity.
 Constructable machines will depend on R&D parts DNA scanner: Laser quality lessens the irradiation Manipulator quality drastically improves the precision(9 times with best part) Scanner quality allows to scan suiciders/ling husks, best part enables cloner's autoprocess button, making it scan people in the scanner automatically Clone pod: Manipulator quality improves the speed of cloning Scanning module quality affects with how much health people will be ejected, will they get negative mutation/no mutations/clean of all mutations/random good mutation, at best quality will enable clone console's autoprocess button and will try to clone all the dead people in records automatically, together with best DNA scanner parts cloning console will be able to work in full automatic regime autoscanning people and autocloning them Borg recharger: Capacitors' quality and powercell max charge affect the speed at which borgs recharge Manipulator quality allows borg to be slowly repaired while inside the recharges, best manipulator allows even fire damage to be slowly repaired Portable power generators: Capacitors' quality produce more power Better lasers consume less fuel and reduce heat production PACMAN with best parts can keep whole station powered with about sheet of plamsa per minute(approximately, wasnt potent enough to test) Protolathe: Manipulators quality affects the cost of things(they will also have less m_amt and g_amt to prevent production of infinity metal), best manipulators reduces the cost 5 times (!) Imprinter: Manipulator quality affects the cost, best manipulator reduce cost(acid insluded) 4 times, i.e. 20 boards per 100 units of acid Destructive analyzer: Better parts allow items with less reliability in Redone how reliability is handled, you now see item reliability in the deconstruction menu and deconstructing items that has same or one point less research type level will rise the reliability of all known designs that has one or more research type requarements as the deconstructed item Designs of the same type raise in reliability more Removed reliability_base and reliability_mod completely because they served no purpose Critically broken things rise reliability of the design drastically Whole reliability system is not used a lot but now at least on the R&D part it finally matters Didnt touch telecomms machinery, R&D code is messy but tcomms is just another level, im not high enough to touch it yet Most of things except for pacman are tested ingame, no bugs/runtimes detected

 Merge pull request #2019 from Jordie0608/Dogmas Added reindeer hats
 Added a failsafe, default_laws is now a config option.
 update_icons() uses animate() and transforms to actually turn the sprite rather than needing them pre-turned. Mobs that lie down do so with an animation rather than appearing on their side. You can lie down facing THE LEFT OH SHIT. Cloakers still don't work well. The fix is probably just finding a proc that runs on equip/uequip/when bagged/when dropped. Fuck that. Ninjas work. Things that are cloaked fade to the cloaked alpha, it's pretty cool. The "lying down" icon_states for everything you could equip are all now unnecessary. They aren't removed yet though. The dmi changes are to make xenos all face upward so when they turn, they're lying down rather than facing south and looking like they're doing a handstand. They're not terribly good when facing the wrong way. I expect WJohnson to have a fix for this by New Year's. Comments aren't changed. The overlays_standing list is still around because overlays is not a normal list, and BYOND's normal list functions are worth the extra cost of keeping a spare list of images.

 Feature: Changed how used books of mindswap punish people. Now if you use a used mindswap book it marks you to be used in a mindswap with the next unfortunate soul who reads its. Some Limitations: You can escape the impending mindswap by changing forms or being dead when the next time someone tries to read the book. You can of course also just keep the book safe or destroy it if you accidentally read one. Only works with things that have hands. Consider intentionally reading one as a monkey then giving it to the captain. Feature: After some serious testing (and because it was already being done on live servers thanks to wabbajack() preserving spells) I've removed the compatible_mobs list for mind_transfer, meaning you can now mind transfer to any player controled living mob. Flowery fluff that no one would ever care about: changes the mindswap message for trying to swap into a dead guy, since a spell holder isn't nessisarily a space wizard

 * Added cards to the perma brig and to the dorms.

Added these intercoms in the gulag, the perma brig and the brig cells. * When a prisoner has received enough points for freedom, if they try to move the shuttle, or open the middle door, while someone is on it they will get an error message. This way there is no way for a free'd prisoner to release their fellow prisoners once they have reached their point target. The shuttle will depart right away when you call the shuttle from the stacking console, to stop prisoners from getting on while it departs.

 feature: renames the monkeyizing var to "notransform" since that's how it was being used in the code, as a flag to tell code to ignore transformation (initially because they were already turning into a monkey). bugfix: gives notransform to etheral jaunting based on an observed edge case where a wizard was staff of changed while starting a jaunt and got stuck in bluespace for the rest of the round meta: modified revive() so I could remove all that horrible snowflake I introduced to let reviving simple mobs come back

 Bugfix: Adds a var to simple animals "player_controlled" to surpress behaviors in simple_animals that have players assigned. Bugfix: Dead player mice won't be converted to items so they can still be revived. Bugfix: Players playing chicks won't die by developing into chickens anymore Bugfix: Fixes an edge case where a poor soul struck by multiple polymorphing shots at once ends up in a state where they can't move. Feature: Renames the wand of resurrection to the wand of healing to drive home the fact that it does the same things the staff of healing can do Balancing: Gives the wand of healing more shots. 10, 5, 5, 4 up from 3, 2, 2, 1

 Shuttle launch timer cannot be shortened when less than 11 seconds are left. Added a check to see if the timer is less than 11 seconds before attempting to change the timer. No message is give to the player, but since this is such a rare thing it shouldn't matter. Using your ID on the console doesn't give you any feedback while in flight either so whatever. Also removed an unused pair of "()". Fixes issue [#2064](https://github.com/tgstation/-tg-station/issues/2064).

 Completed the transition to a new proc All the logging i have found in the code was changed to use the proc(maybe i missed something) Killed all runtimes found so far Proc now handles all the checks, no need to add checks in the body of object
 Fixed some runtimes and bugs regarding mob transformations and changelings. Now only monkeys and humans will have the changeling verbs when they change bodies. Brains, slimes and aliens won't.
 Fixed some runtimes regarding the datum of the objecting being built being deleted while being constructed.
 Nuke Op Tweaks In response to feedback: Dark Gygax no longer has the scattershot. Instead, it has a modestly powerful carbine loaded with incendiary rounds, solidifying its role as a hit-and-run and squad-support platform. The Mauler now has the scattershot in addition to its existing arsenal, to give it that edge against crowds that you'll need at those higher populations. Included with the new mecha weapon is a minor code refactoring of mech guns... There shouldn't be any noticable changes to the user. mech code is awful, guys New sound effect for mecha launchers (Having the same sound effect for projectile launching and exploding drove me nuts.). Nuke op flamethrowers now start with a full tank.
 Feature: Adds summon guns and summon magic as fun secrets for badmins Bugfix: Prevents people from becoming the survivor multiple times
 Removes the staff of animation from summon magic. I never intended for it to be there and it's OP as hell.
 Added some checks on the photocopier after the sleeps to avoid runtimes and made a new var "busy" to avoid exploits that ignored the wait times.

 Merge pull request #1872 from Adrinus/11-23-2013-Games Adds a deck of cards.
 Adds a deck of cards. Works like real cards, without all the shuffling. Fixed a few unforseen bugs and smoothed out a few odd quirks. Fixed bugs, added flipping mechanics. Made the cards less cheater friendly by making certain actions visible. Added the ability to choose between "Random Card" and "draw from Top" with a verb on the deck. While held in hand the deck can now be shuffled. Had to improve sprites, was really bugging me. Now uses the shuffle() list helper. Added cardshuffle.ogg to sound/items/ Cooldown applied to shuffling for "sanity" as the term seems to be. Made a few changes to the way the cards prompt you for less clutter. Merge pull request #1 from Zelacks/deckstuff Replaces the global decks variable with a reference Now card is taken from hand on topic choice. Examine card has been scrapped, just attack_self() with the card to see what it is. New Icons. Dig that NanoTrasen blue. Thanks Nienhaus! Merge pull request #2 from Zelacks/deckstuff Hopefully you will like these changes - Several deck changes Fixed a few nits and picks. Made Deck of Cards available as a prize from the arcade machines.

Adeed a series of fixes to the Mousedrop function. Made all notices uniform. Made changes to keep cards being flipped by the wrong sorts. Added Razharas' "more readable" pixel art for the cards. Made messages about the deck work while the deck is held. (I guess you might want to carry it) Un-Needed cooldown removed from shuffling the deck.

 <span> and cable use() - Added more span tags - using cable now uses use() - fixed use() to correctly return 1 when it succeeds - checked that there were no checks that would’ve been previously borked. For testing purposes I renamed use to use_cable (‘use’ is kinda bad for a proc name, but use_cable is hardly better), but left that out of the commit because it would’ve inflated the pr.
 A change to how "continuous_round_wiz" works Currently, if the config option for continuous wizard rounds is off the round will end immediately following the death of the wizard. With this change after the death of the wizard the game will additionally check to see if the wizard has made any antagonists that are still alive to do things after his death. The round won't end unless these antags don't exist or have all already died as well. This allows for summon guns/magics survivors to not get blueballed out of antag round because the wizard died quickly. Additionally this allows wizards who made apprentices the chance for them to get the wizard alive again (the new healing apprentice has a staff that can raise the dead who is uniquely suited to this task.) Additionally additionally this allows for a mindswap wizard to not get instantly meta'd out when the round doesn't end when the wizard's head is caved it WITHOUT forcing extended on people. This change was originally part of the Magic Mania pull, but was removed and placed in its own PR on request.

 * Quick fix to combat hypos still giving an error message when they are able to inject.
 Made changes based on feedback. The pen/hypo/borghypo doesn't give a poke message when it fails to inject someone wearing protective gear. Fixed a typo. Reworded the can_inject() error message for humans so it makes sense with a normal pen. Made the combat hypo (nuke ops item) ignore protective gear, to allow syndies to heal their comrades.

 * Added the THICKMATERIAL flag. It is used for thick coverall suits (space suits, firesuits, etc) and it will stop injections from syringes, hypos and parapens. It is also used for head items such as biohoods and space helmets. If you aim for the head, it will check if you can inject through the head equipped item, if you aim anywhere else it will check the external suit. Let me know if I missed an item or if you don't think an item should have the flag. * Cleaned up a bit of the gun code. * Fixed an issue with shotgun darts not working in barrel shotguns. * Made the on_hit() have a zone, will be used for syringe guns in another PR. * Removed the unused sleepy pen. * Changed /obj/item/weapon/gun/projectile/shotgun/pump/sc_pump to /obj/item/weapon/gun/projectile/shotgun/sc_pump, there was no /pump/ anywhere else. * Shotgun darts will follow the new flag. * Shotgun darts are now open containers, and I removed the snowflake check for them in syringes. * Added logging for reagents in any projectile.

 A small change to how wizard rounds end when continuous wizard rounds are off: After the game has determinded that the wizard is dead it will check if there's any traitors alive. "Traitors" in this instance means apprentices and survivors the wizard may have created with contracts/summon guns/summon magic. Thus if the round still has a chance of being interesting (survivors) and/or the wizard has a legitimate chance at revival (apprentices) the round keeps going.

 Suggestion implimentation patch! *Span classes the whole update *Spellbooks no longer vanish after being used, instead used spellbooks now have various bad effects should they be attempted to learned from again (the original reader won't acidentally fall to this, as they will just say "I've already read this"). Leave em out as traps for people or properly dispose of your trash! Or... *The charge spell can now attempt to recharge one use spellbooks so someone else can learn the spell. This only has a 20% success rate and will destroy the book should it fail (even if the book was actually unused). You can't attempt this on the wizard's spellbook *The "staff of nothing" (functional) placeholder now uses the generic staff sprites *Spellbooks can now be placed in bookshelves just like normal books *The teleport spell won't yank anchored things anymore, but as a consolation it will warp the entire contents of a tile should it be targeted. The code has been tweeked so this shouldn't effect the server too bad even if large numbers of items are warped to unique locations this way

 Infinite cell button fix, more banned items.
 Summon Magic / Charge / Wands&Staffs / One time spellbooks / New Apprentice --- Summon Magic: This new wizard spell works much like summon guns except it instead brings the crew magical tools and weapons. There are preexisting artifacts (minus some that would cause huge confusion/balance issues) as well as new spellbooks, wands, and a staff. The chance of survivor antag is the same as summon guns. --- Charge: This new spell allows for the recharging of otherwise unrefillable wands, but there's a heavy chance that the total number of charges will decrease with each casting until eventually they're impossible to keep recharging. As a bonus the charge spell can also be used to charge batteries and things that run on batteries (such as energy weapons). This carries the same max charge weardown penalties however. Lastly this spell allows a wizard to charge other wizards with a grab, reseting their spell cooldown. They cannot use it to charge themselves. It has a 60 second cooldown. The wizard cannot buy this spell himself, it only comes randomly to the crew during Summon Magic and with the new apprentice loadout. --- Wands&Staffs: Magic weapons have been overhauled into their own catagory so there won't be any more weirdness with batteries in staves or apparent magic resistance on things that reflect energy weapons. Wands have been added, these wands come precharged with a number of shots that can be fired off at their leasure but cannot be recharged once emptied (unless the charge spell is used). They come in a varity of exciting flavors: *Death: Slays instantly but has very few shots (1 to 3) *Resurrection: Revives and/or heals instantly but has very few shots (1 to 3) *Polymorph: Same function as the staff of change *Teleport: Weaponized blink spell that doesn't respect space tiles and can also warp away machinery or items (but not turf) *Door Creation: Puts easy access wooden doors in walls *Fireball: Same function (but slightly lower damage) as the fireball spell *Nothing: Lame and useless Wands can also be used on the user (unlike staves) by clicking on them. Warning messages have been added to a few wands so people don't accidentally zap themselves with the wand of death unless they really want to. Wands cannot be aquired by the wizard directly, and are only spawned during castings of summon magic. There is also a new staff, the staff of healing, which works as a recharging version of the wand of resurrection. The new apprentice starts with one of these, and they can also be found during summon magic. The wizard cannot purchase it directly, and as a stave he could not use it on himself anyways. --- One time spellbooks: Found exclusively in summon magic are one time use spellbooks that can teach any player a robeless spell. Once read the book vanishes. Books come in the following flavors: *fireball *smoke *blind *mindswap *forcewall *knock *curse of the horsemen *charge (described above) --- New apprentice: A fourth loadout for apprentice wizards has been added. This wizard is intended as a support role and comes with forcewall (for cover) and charge (used to keep him and the wizard well stocked in laser weaponry or to restore the wizard's cooldowns). It also comes equiped with a free Staff of Healing for keeping the wizard alive. Shoot the medic first folks.

 Clarifies the Changelog
 Changelog
 Added a check for the target of the magic missile between the sleeps. This will stop the runtimes and the MM objects from being stuck in the spot (I think you can pull them though)
 Re-fixed the flashers after breaking them
 Fixed the greyed out portable flasher issue.
 Makes the clusterbang launcher unlimited use. Reduces the number of projectiles per reload by half, doubles reload energy cost, and raises the cooldown from 60 to 90. Changes the name to something more humorous from SOP-6 to SOB-3. Raised to mineral cost to that more like the HONK blast. Only noticeable "bug":the ammo count won't update till the cooldown is over. Also, prevents rearming during the cooldown though.

 Updated changelog to a table of symptoms.
 Viruses are less random and you can determine the level of symptom you would get. Virus food will generate low level symptoms, Mutagen will generate medium level symptoms and Liquid Plasma will generate high level symptoms. Virologist starts with a small bottle of liquid plasma. Filled in the gaps between the chem master with RGBA(255, 255, 255, 1) so you do not accidentally click on the floor anymore. ChemMasters now has the green light overlay, which is only used by Pandemics but it looks better than red.
 Adds a stat check for AI vocal announcements. Fixes #1908 Moves some other checks under input, as they could change after input is done.
 Bomb payload big...yeah yeah yeah! It's not small...no no no!
 Sparks won't be spawned in a null location if the holodeck changes the target before their time to spawn. This will stop some runtimes. Shotguns won't runtime when pumped.
 Removed the need of the input and output object for the machinery of mining. They will now use the input_dir and output_dir vars.

Default is 2 now. * The crusher can now be used by a screwdriver to de-emag it.
 Forgot to add the flask to the tunic
 Expanded the suit storage for the Captain's Tunic Made the suit storage on the Captain's Tunic more useful than just a place to store your e-o2 tank.

 Added some sanity check for when the humanize() proc call finishes. This proc includes a sleep() and it might return nothing of the mob is deleted before the sleep ends. Others way to engage the issue wouldn't be fair.
 Updated MetaStation.v38K.dmm to MetaStation.v38L.dmm -Improved the transit tube spacedust/meteor shield. -Added camera to chemistry. -Added pepper spray dispenser to medbay security post. -Added more potted plants to the arrivals lounge. -Added EVA Shutter and Gateway Shutter buttons near the actual shutters. -Added "PhotoSynthetic Plant" to the AI core, replacing the toy. -Added brig emergency storage room behind the brig medical room. -Added more fire safety lockers around maint. and in each EM storage room. -Added arcade machine to the fitness rooms to make up for the loss of the one at dorms. -Added unique orange hardhat and orange gloves to construction area. -Added meson scanners to the CE office. -Added an extra securitron that starts its patrol from escape - "Inspector Johnson". -Added a functional (but switched-off) CleanBot Exhibit to the corporate showroom. -Added a dead plant to the labour camp. -Added more xeno spawns to new maint. rooms. -Added lots of costumes and lipstick to one of the maint. rooms. -Added more fluff gear to the maint. room closest to the engineering foyer. -Added some science satchels to the telescience room. -Added a lot more budget insulated gloves. -Added a second prison wing lock-down control just outside the prison, and moved the prison APC so shunted malf AIs can see it. -Added a mini-morgue to the detective's office. -Re-added auxiliary bathrooms opposite mailroom, left of the library. -Adjusted paper tray at south side of the cargo bay, should not be hanging off the edge of it any more. -Adjusted the layout of the lawyer's office to better use space. -Moved the tube-lamp from the firelock near arrivals, between the arrivals and transit shuttle docks. -Removed unneeded privacy shutter button and lightswitch from detective's office. -Removed robocop law board from AI upload secure case. -Removed the space computer/buttons by the armoury. -Removed disposal unit under kitchen fridge. -Removed tile in the syndie shuttle that prevented syndies pushing things into the teleporter. -Rearranged security office and officer gear room. -Rearranged a few items at the MiniSat, and improved the positioning of the turrets. -Replaced turrets at the MiniSat with real turrets with correct area designations. -Replaced the MiniSat SMES cell with wiring to the station and a backup generator. -Fixed wiring to the holodeck. -Fixed wiring to medbay security post. -Fixed double stacked window at 110, 80, 1. -Fixed white tile instead of plating at 85, 84, 1. -Fixed unnecessary rwalls at 66, 94, 1 and 119, 76, 1. -Fixed broken disposal units at the warden's office and security locker room. -Fixed xeno maint. access - it is now scientist level access. -Made it possible to hide behind all potted plants on the station. -Made windows between chapel and escape tinted. -Made all 3 securitrons on station-stronger (higher health). -Made prison wing blast doors more visible by bringing them forward a tile. -Moved the holopad behind the bar and expanded the table for mixing drinks. -Electrified some windows in security that were missed.
 Added some sanity after the spawn() procs in the wire datums of APCs
 Fixed a runtime regarding stunning yourself with items that delete themselves once dropped. Hello ninja swords.
 Syndicate Bomb Tweaks: Syndicate Bombs now have enforced 60 second minimum timers, up from 30. Their crystal cost remains at 5. Syndicate Detonators that can get around the 60 second timers are purchasable for 1 crystal for all (there are also ways to get around it with clever uses of the wires, but that's not new) The Nuke Agents get a free syndicate detonator [MAP] Syndicate Bombs can now be further disassembled beyond disarming them to let people actually lift the explosives out of the bomb, rendering it useless. These explosives will only detonate in the presence of another explosion, and give great research levels.
 Because turfs don't give a fuck, added a sanity check when the spawn() of MakeSlippery() is engaged. Turfs can change but the procs won't stop.
 NanoUIs will now only transfer their mob UI list on a mob transformation if the old mob exists. No extra checks, just better placement for the NanoUI user_transfered() proc call. This will fix some runtimes.
 Meh. Added some checks to see if the mob that you just pulled to a location still exists once it finished their step()
 Adrenalin implants will now actually add their reagents instead of runtime and cry.
 Observing before the round stops loading won't generate runtimes anymore by ghosts making querys for the station's name. The station name will wait warmly and finally be created properly by the master controller.
 Sets frequency of spec ops officer radios to 144.1 so they can communicate with deathsquads, who are also set to that frequency. Mostly for my own conveneience.
 Ghosts won't runtime if they click on the portal while the teleporter computer is gone
 Clientless aliens won't runtime anymore when they change their plasma levels.

 Moved up Bump() in silicon.dm, and tested it. According to my tests, unachored AI and Borgs behave as normal when bumped by a mob. A human can swap places with a borg if both have help intent on when moving... But a borg can't swap places with a human if both have help intent on, if it's the borg that's moving. Apparently it's a normal behavior, tested it on Sibyl. AI don't have intents so they just get pushed. pAIs aren't affected by bump, as they seem to act like as objects when walked over or thrown. Decoys seems to be some old MALF module that isn't in use anymore, so I didn't touch it.

Made all sounds use 3D sounds! This includes sounds which have less volume the further away you are from it. The piano now uses 3D sounds. Changed how the far explosion sound is calculated.

 Corrected the date formay in the changelog. YOU SAW NOTHING!
 Changelog updated. Added commit's description to changelog.
 AI can now anchor/unanchor itself. Add a Toggle Anchor Bolt verb to the AI that allows it to toggle his 'anchored' var and be dragged around. You cannot use the bolt verb in a locker,disposal, pipe , on a mule or as a card. Tested Interactions between AI and items : -While the AI can be dragged, it cannot be pushed. You can however, while dragging it, move it around on tiles(by clicking on said tile),if you get stuck. -Cannot be grabbed or click dropped into the gibber. -Cannot be grabbed or click dropped into Cryo. -Cannot be put in the DNA scanner. -Cannot be put in the morgue, or the incinerator. -CAN be grabbed or click dropped into a disposals bin, and flushed. -CAN be put inside a locker. Once there's a locker below and you can close it, you can drag the AI around - event if it's normally anchored. If you open the closet while the AI is anchored, the Ai will still be in a anchored state. Note that it's possible to do this trick without needing to drag the Ai over a locker, PRIOR to this commit. -Can drift in space, and can be mass-driver'd. Also Anchors don't work in spess.Also Ai goes blind in spess. Honk. -Can be pulled around on edges in space as normal, slip interaction works normally. -Can be telescience'd if unanchored. -You can get on a mulebot! Notable problem : -Ai can be buckled/unbuckled to a chair, and when unbuckled it reverts to an anchored state.Can be solved by using the verb again. Not a real issue, but notable. -Dragging an AI in open space can be a bit of a problem. If you take sharp turns while jetpacking, the Ai will still drift in the previous direction. You can stop the AI course by jumping by getting in front of it. Dead AIs were however able to go through you, but Gia found a fix. "Doesn't that defeat the purpose of the intellicard?" No, because you only use the card for 3 cases : 1. In case of Rogue AIs, and it is unlikely it will let you drag it around. 2. In case od dead AIs, in which case it will still need to be carded in order to be resurected. 3. In order to steal the AI, and generally they don't like that as well. So the intellicard will still show uses if this commit gets pulled. Many thanks to Giacommand for babysitting me and helping me through the coding and testing stages of this commit. Also, first baby commit, ho! I've thought of this when Gia decided to change Telescience to not drag anchored mobs, and realised that this create a lot of fun options for the AI (rogue or not). Most of the interactions seems to be clear of bugs, and I didn't get any runtimes when testing (except something about NanoUI, but Gia and me assumed it was unrelated.)

 Adds a shutter to the nuke op base that opens with a button behind the squad leader's desk. A small speedbump intended to discourage lone wolf ops from sprinting to the shuttle before the team can even begin to coordinate.
 Added a changelog.
 Telescience now uses projectile trajectories to calculate the tile to teleport to. The user can set a rotation (the direction the teleport will send him), the power (the amount of power the telepad will use, basically the x velocity) and the angle (which is the y velocity). The random factor is that the power is randomly offset everytime you recalibrate the telepad. There is a delay between each use of the teleport, which is calculated by the time it takes for a projectile to hit a destination. There is also a delay determined by the amount of power you use. Added a manual for telescience, which links to the wiki.
 Undoes changes to emitter.dm & field_generator.dm in my other commits, then applies bugfix.

 Blobs will slowly regenerate health when pulsed. They have a second cooldown after every pulse to make sure 5 nodes aren't healing them too quickly. Changed how the overmind hud was updated so that it was more accurate. Instead of updating every life() it will update everytime the blob core health changes and everytime the resource count changes. Renamed the expand power to "expand/attack", to make it more clear to new blubbers that you use it to attack people.
 Removed potential runtime from spawning projectile/shotgun. Also made it so shotguns actually load shotgun shells.
 Merge pull request #1690 from Metacide/master Updated MetaStation.v37G.II.dmm to MetaStation.v37H.dmm
 Updated MetaStation.v37G.II.dmm to MetaStation.v37H.dmm -Added virology smartfridge. -Added chemistry smartfridge. -Added more fire extinguishers to security. -Added cable coils to chemistry. -Added more briefcases to the map. -Added secure briefcases for each head and the detective. -Added bookbinder and photocopier to library. -Removed anomalous rwall by janitor's closet. -Updated maint. doors so they should all unlock correctly when heads use the emergency maint. all-access protocol. -Updated bomb test site camera so it should no longer runtime. -Updated the commemorative plaque near arrivals, which now displays the normal message and the map version number. -Fixed prison monitors just ouside the prison and in the lawyer's office. -Fixed genetics lab being visible to the public hallway, causing Beepsky to try and attack the monkeys within. -Turned pumps (but not taps) on by default for O2/N2 to airmix in atmos.

 Replaced the wizard den's bedsheet with the wiz bedsheet.
 When the game tries to find players for roles it will now prioritize players who are the least afk. For example, it will try to find players that are afk for 5 minutes or lower, if it fails it'll add a minute to the 5 minutes until it finds a candidate or until it reaches 10 minutes. I changed the get_candidate for aliens so that their 5 minute bracket is instead 45 seconds. This is because a lot of the time larva need to be active ASAP to avoid danger (such as being spawned in dangerous areas) There was a cases of an AFK larva that was very easily killed of, making it fraustrating for the observers watching.
 Fixed up Scanning Module naming

Now it compiles and doesn't throw runtimes! Also chambering rounds works right! Unfortunately the contents still need to be looked at, the Russian Revolver isn't working, and the Bartender's shotgun is just a nightmare. Also you still can't eject mags. Mags eject, most gun work. Shotguns still have a problem with reloading and chambering. Russian Revolver is a bitch. Heavy finalizing touches. Fixed references to changed trees. Added icon_states for some magazines. Fixed revolver glitches and subtyped double-barreled shotguns to revolvers to fix its glitches. Made bullets and spent shells more obvious via graphical changes. Probably did some other things but I can't think of what they'd be. Sprite tweaks for final preparations for pull request. final FINAL finalizations. Adding full paths to overwritten procs for simplicity's sake. Fixing damaged .gitignore and config/admins.txt. Finalization for pull preparation. Clean up some descs, eliminate data folder.
 Instead of overall health, clonee ejection is based on cloneloss. This eliminates the need for healing (inaprovaline is still injected otherwise they'll die of choking since they start in crit)

 Made containment fields shock you when you walk into them, not when you walk near them.

The containment field will now shock you when it is created. The containment field layer is a little above objects, so objects going through are under the field icon. Cleaned up a bit of the code.

 Removes the .dme (I hope)
 Adds a border object list to turfs This removes some unnecessary or redundant checks in turf/Enter(). Also fixes a movement glitch involving atoms moving out of an object (locker, etc) and into walls.
 Replaces atom/HasEntered() with the builtin atom/movable/Crossed() Crossed() is a byond builtin which is called automatically when two movable atoms overlap (as a side effect of Move(), but not when loc or x/y/z is changed). Previously, turf/Entered() iterated through all objects in the turf in order to tell them an object had entered; with this change, HasEntered() becomes redundant and can be eliminated. This may reduce lag when a large number of objects are moving in a small space (singularity, mining conveyors, etc) but should cause no changes to functionality at all.
 Moved #defines Moves the constants from defines and compile_options files into the __DEFINES directory. The compile options in the latter file that are actually tweakable remain in their existing file in the code directory. Constants from DEFINES.dm, globals.dm, names.dm, and global_lists.dm have been moved into the _globalvars subdirectory. stylesheet.dm has been moved into the interface directory since that's a better place for it. This move contains no code changes for stock TG. It is purely an organizational move meant to clean up hard to read code. Some global constants that appear to be unused have been put into unused.dm, but not unticked. This list is by no means exhaustive. Branches should be aware that they need to move any additional defines and global constants manually.

 Cyborg construction now stores endoskeleton for deconstruction to use When you construct a cyborg now, the endoskeleton is stored in the mob, where before it was deleted. Cyborg deconstruction now checks if there is a stored endoskeleton. If there is, it deconstructs it. If there isn't, it spawns new parts like before. Also, there is now a burn_out proc for flashes, since the feature was previously copypasta.

 Telecrystal Management Consoles Designed for Nuke Ops, these two consoles work to allow a nuke team to manage their TC. The TC Stations accept any uplink item. Once the uplink is inserted, they can donate their TC to the group's boss console. The boss console can then take its TC pool and distribute it among the hooked uplink stations. It gets an amount of bonus TC based on the round population, allowing nuke op equipment to scale with the increased threat of a fully-manned station. (and hopefully make gearing up a better experience overall, with no more "WHO'S GOT THE RADIO?!")
 Double agents can now be picked for late joiners. This works by keeping a list of players who are applicable for double agents and then after a certain number of them are picked it will tell them all to kill each other. Increased the amount of double agents that start in the round (x1.5).

 Removes the turf from the air controller when any shuttles moves. They are added back afterwards. This will avoid having walls on the active turf list who runtime to hell. Basically, it removes all the turfs from both sides (where the shuttle was and where it docks) and then tries to add them back normally.

 Fix for runtimes and an issue with flag conflicts. Signed-off-by: Mloc <colmohici@gmail.com>
 Evens out space lighting and prevents space fire/party alarms Adds a dedicated lighting subarea for space turfs, and forces all space turfs to use it. This evens out irregularities in lighting space turfs ("this empty space is slightly brighter than that empty space") and removes fire and party alarms from space tiles. For now I have also made space lighting subareas unpowered. I guess this operates on the theory that the tiles mysteriously teleport power between themselves (along with flashing red lights and party strobes) but it does not work on empty space.

 Mecha HUD hiding Hides the user's inventory (as per F12) when they enter a mecha, since it is essentially unusable. Pressing F12 will reveal it, as will exiting the mecha. If your inventory is hidden before you enter the mech, it will remain hidden when you leave.

 Merge pull request #1580 from Atskadan/grammarfix Fixes "Its locked!" in lockbox.dm
 * Fixed the monitors on the map, that weren't working. They needed a list instead of a string text.
 * Added a changelog entry.
 * The AI can now use alt click to get a list of objects and the turf for easy access. * The AI can interact with all the items in the list. * The AI can use this for several things: * Since the list will not dissappear for the AI, until there's no camera coverage, they can use it to bookmark a single tile to interact while not having to look at it. * They can also use this to quickly jump to the listed turf. * They can interact with objects under other objects. * Made the CTRL Click on the APC directly use the toggle_breaker() proc.
 * Fixed SS13 causing players to stop auto-connecting to the server because of duplicate keys.
 Merge pull request #1571 from Malkevin/galoshesB Fixed Janicart and Galoshes crate not being orderable
 Update Malf_Modules.dm Changed the uses from 2 to 4.
 Added a batch-script to easily upload **tgstation.rsc** to an external server, for use with **external_rsc_url.txt**. **Run this script every time you have compiled your code if you are using external_rsc_url.txt, otherwise players will get errors when joining.** Edit the batch-script with your login details ----- * Replace **USERNAME** with your FTP username * Replace **PASSWORD** with your FTP password * Replace **FOLDER/FOLDER** with the folder on the FTP server where you want to store **tgstation.rsc**, for example: **cd www/rsc** * Replace **FTP.DOMAIN.COM** with the IP-address or domain name of your FTP server * Add the URL to the location of **tgstation.rsc** on your webserver into **data\external_rsc_urls.txt**
 Fixes "Its locked! in lockbox.dm to say "It's locked!" as it should
 I can't into spelling.
 * The Allow AI config option will now correctly stop players from choosing AI as a job. * The job select screen will now fill in the rest of the last column, so it doesn't look uneven.

 Merge pull request #1560 from AlexanderUlanH/cryo Fixed Cryotube Deletion runtime
 * Added a new malf power: Machine Override will delete the machine and swap it with a mimic, with generated attack stats and the same icon as the machine it has replaced. Effectively making it look like the machine is attacking people. * The power will cost the same as overload. * Reduced the price and uses of uncommon malf powers so that they can be used when the AI only has 5-10 points left.

Special guns seem to work fine on animals (like the syringe gun for example). *Mutant races were not updating properly thanks the DNA revamp, so that's been fixed and expanded to include all current races. *Transfering identity for MMI's in newly created robots has been disabled for animal -> robot because it doesn't work properly for them, robot -> robot also apparently NEVER worked and has likewise been disabled.

 Merge pull request #1508 from Ergovisavi/toydualfix Fixes an issue where toy dualsabers would reflect like actual dualsabers
 * Tweaked the brand intelligence event to use the mimic copy class. * Mimic vending machines will now also talk. * Reduced the chance for a vending machine to explode, instead of becoming a mimic.
 Galoshes B: Janicart crate comes with galoshes Adds a pair of Galoshes to the Janicart crate This alternative allows new spawning Janitors to get their noslips, allows HoP assigned Janitors to get their no slips, and maintains the ability for thieving greyshirts to steal the janitors yellow boots, and gives cargo something else to order. The reason I chucked in a free pair of galoshes into the janicart crate instead of making a new crate is because I see that crate as the new janitor's starter pack, and its also to incentivise that the crate is meant to be ordered for new janitors and not power gaming assholes (although they probably will still do it -meh). The reason for this change is because the HoP can increase the number of Janitors on station (which is a good thing for them to do because one janitor can't keep the station clean), however the new janitors are at a disadvantage because they can never get a pair of no slip galoshes and Aran made it so only water can clean stuff via mopping, not even space cleaner works.

 * Napalm works again, which fixes incendiary grenades. * Stopped the fuel and n20 option, in spawn_air, from runtiming. * Added toxins as a spawn_air option. * Removed all use of the fuel option and replaced it with toxins, since fuel does not work with LINDA anymore.
 Made reagent descriptions nicer (Also I forgot to finish it before! Woops.)
 Added the ..() as lord Giacom requested. Added changes to grinder that giacom did. May as well let them piggyback on this commit and hope it somehow forces my gloriously bads crayon powder to be pulled.
 * Forgot comment.
 * Fixed disposal units not starting with full pressure. * Fixed some disposal units starting unconnected to the trunk, by checking for trunk during initialization.

 No longer assuming the targetted job level, it'll be forcibly set from now on. This should prevent any issues where a job cannot be switched either way (up/down).
 Improved APC fix: breaker can be toggled regardless of power, power can be set to off or auto when there's no power instead of only off.
 * Fixed hostile mobs being able to attach through windows (thanks to the new click code's Adjacent proc) * Made the shift examine turn your mob again. * Slightly optimized getting the modifier params, in the click code.
 The trans_to proc for /datum/reagents/ now detects and accepts /datum/reagents/ as targets instead of just reagent_containers. Updated the hydroponics attack_by to use that new feature. Improved the microwave-cleaning to use amount_per_transfer_from_this. It does ignore other reagents, only using up space cleaner, because it really doesn't need to be complicated.

 Fixes corner-case exploit regarding nar-sie and red alert Changes the time the shuttle comes with a nar-sie to 3 minutes, as Centcom is probably rushing anyway because there is a giant unidentified god running around the station.
 Fixed simple hunter sprites, too.
 Alien *roar and *deathgasp sounds are no longer spammable.

 Fixes the last few issues with the computer update.
 -You can now remove the toner cardridge from an airlock painter by clicking on the painter in your hand. -You can now install a toner cardridge into an airlock painter by clicking on it with the toner.
 Fixes and improvements to airlock painters. -Airlock painter can now be used on finished airlocks to change their paintjob. Keep away from the Clown. -Airlock painter description up to standards. It still shows the current ink level. -Fixed a bug with painting airlock assemblies where painted glass airlocks deconstructed to assemblies reconstructed to airlocks would lose their glass status. -Airlock painters now make a sound (effects/spray2.ogg) when used to paint an airlock.
 Adds the ability to place five different kinds of flowers on your head, each with their own new mob sprite.
 Returns 1 instead of adding (more) special cases to the afterattack functions for beakers and spray bottles.
 Cleans up the new cyborg floortile, Thanks for spotting it Aran!

 The message now gets printed out from the *receiving* console(s) instead of the sending console. Whoops. Also, there are multiple request consoles of certain types. Most notably, the security request consoles are all on the same "network" - they can't send to each other, and they all receive any request sent to security.
 Disables the afterattack for spray bottles and beakers when applied to hydro trays so they don't splash/spray (spray bottles didn't do anything special to blobs). Improved some text. Empty syringe is still ready for extraction code when that gets implemented. Fixed a double-the error. Noticed that hydroponics code is full of them. Cleaned them up.

 - fixed ais being able to use computer when it was powered down
 -Petethegoat is love. Petethegoat is life. Made the procs global, so both the physical computer and the AI use the same proc.
 Radiation Collector analyzing Checking a collector's last power output via analyzers has been moved to multitools, because that actually made sense (betcha didn't know this existed, I know I didn't) Analyzers can now be used to check the gas level of the tank in a loaded radiation collector (yay no more crowbars) You can also use them on pipes to check gas levels (yay no more pipe meters) Codewise, the several inconsistant instances of the analyzer code have been moved to a single proc. The following have been converted to use this: -Pipes (they didn't have this before. Also changed the attackby code to be less dumb...) -Pipe tanks (you know those big ones in maint everyone forgets about) -Portable Atmospherics (canisters, air pumps, scrubbers) -Flamethrower -Tanks -And now collectors
 Merged eject contents and occupant to one verb, added Del() proc
 Resets weapons.dmi and tgstation.dme, meaning that the only diffs are to the code .dms (and those changes should be correct). Next commit will handle adding the icons back to the synced .dmis.

 Atmos machinery sprite fixes
 Fixes1404 by changing how hydro trays can receive reagents. Pretty much any reagent container works now, except pills. Food *does* work, it's used as "compost". I might make pills work as compost as well, kinda like those solid Miracle Grow supplements. Issue #1404 was just that plant-b-gone bottles weren't using their reagent contents on hydro trays. Space cleaner spray was similarly not used or checked when cleaning microwaves, so I fixed that extension of the bug. I haven't tested this as thoroughly as I usually test my commits, I'll update this when I'm confident it's all working. I did run through most possibilities though.

 Anomaly Neutralization Anomalies can now be scanned to determine their frequency, and neutralized by sending a signal on that frequency.
 Typo fix.
 Adds a traitor item ToyAI that can upload the last ion law it generated via an upload console. Note that this is NOT a normal ToyAI that has been emagged, but rather an upload board mimicing a ToyAI (with a tell in the description). This ToyAI has been added to the AI subversion bundle, note that since a traitor with this bundle already gets a hacked AI module there's no added benifit to it being there, its just for whimsical traitors who'd enjoy adding a little spice to the AI or false flag the changes as a badmin ioning an AI.

 Procs out Ion law generation
 Adds a toy AI to the arcade machine prize list. When you press it it'll annouce a random Ion Law to everyone around. This has a cooldown to prevent spammage and to make sure that the switch hell that is AI ion law code isn't taxing things too much (it looks a lot worse than it actually runs). This replaces the blink toy in arcade machines, because they were a terrible booby prizes that no one in their right mind would mistake for something threatening because who in their right mind would leave a syndicate summoning beacon lying around instead of the thing that it summons.
 Adds cryo verb to eject items inside, non-human occupants are ejected
 Merge pull request #1382 from Cheridan/DressingRoom [MAP] Turns theater backroom into a proper dressing room.
 Only standing icons will have female outfits now, both to avoid one time nudity blinking on laying and because clothes don't pull the same way laying down (yeah lets go with that)
 Ported and improved Sayu's awesome alt-click stat panel. Alt-clicking a tile will bring up a list of the objects on it in a stat panel- these can be interacted with normally, with both left and right clicks. This is particularly useful for getting specific items from lockers.
 Fixed. Don't code at 3PM without sleeping for over a day.

 SHOULD ACTUALLY BE FIXED NOW.
 Request consoles print slips when a request comes in. Finishes and enables "Extreme Priority" alerts through hacking, which cause the slip to be (harmlessly) launched at a nearby target. Most recent messages are now at the top, so much less scrolling necessary. Centralizes the request console's icon_state code. Also adds me to the admins.txt because I'm tired of stashing changes to it.
 Aesthetic changes to the code to help unmuddy update_icons.dm a bit: female_uniform_icons is now defined in global_lists.dm A generate_uniform proc has been made in clothing.dm to handle icon generation
 All cultists start with convert words.
 Ports the False Alarm event from Sayustation.

 Bugfixen and minor changes. Fixes #136. Adjusts the click code to not use client/Click(). The code is largely unchanged, except that it allows the compiler default behaviour of calling atom/Click(), and then forwards the call to mob/ClickOn(). I had some reports that melee combat mixed with movement was behaving oddly, and I believe it may be due to the use of client/Click; the byond documentation says that redefining client/Click() causes additional overhead, and it isn't strictly necessary. Alters the way double clicks are handled, in an attempt to better handle clickspam, as often occurs during pitched combat. This may also be responsible for the above, but I don't know. Inserts proximity (aka flag) checks in all afterattack() procs. The old assumption was that unless an item used the USEDELAY flag, afterattack() was only called when adjacent, but this is no longer true. This led to beakers, soap, crayons, etc, all being usable at all ranges. Removes the NODELAY flag, which was unused. Removes all existing uses of the USEDELAY flag so that it can be readded to things that need extra delay. Removes the hand_* procs, previously used by restrained actions. Instead, the mob helper mob/RestrainedClickOn() has abosrbed basically all the functionality they were used for, which is really only monkeys with jungle fever. Adds a special case of the Adjacency() proc for doors. This fixes #136, airlocks being unreachable due to border fire doors. However, this only takes us back to the unpleasant position where you have to open-hand the door, switch to a crowbar, and pry open the firedoor; it still needs a better fix.
 Glove update Integrates gloves into click code. Gloves now have a proc/Touch(atom, proximity) which is called before humans do an attack_hand(). It can also occur when you click on something at range, so be sure to check the proximity flag. Adds code to make ninja gloves work properly with this and pulls it out of the various attack_hand() procs. Other suggested uses: secret society rings, magic/cult gloves, weaponized gloves (chemical, electric, needles, etc), powered exosuit hands (for picking up crates), I dunno, there are options
 Fixes #1164
 Rebase past 6e83288a7837e42d35e451064ce20dde31acff37 to fix conflicts
 Bugfixen Modifies Adjacent() for items, to allow items to be accessed properly inside each other and the user. This fixes a few bugs seen in testing. Sets a maximum telekinesis range (in case you were using cameras). The telekinetic grab now does nothing at all in melee combat. This prevents double messages where you attack them with the object telekinetically, and then also attack them with the telekinetic grab. Crayons had a bug where they were drawing at all distances. This is because in old click code, afterattack() only happened at range when you had the USE_DELAY flag, which is no longer true. Proper behavior is to use parameter 3 (proximity_flag), which is 1 when adjacent or 0 if inaccessible.
 Adds telekinesis to click code. Fixes issue #1202, #1129, #247. This adds two atom procs, attack_tk() and attack_self_tk(). attack_tk is used as per attack_hand; attack_self_tk exists on all atoms (not just items) but is similar to the item proc, but without the assumption that it is in the user's hand. Removes the functionality where entering throw mode would create a tk grab, as it is redundant. As a default, attack_tk does the following: * Creates a telekinetic throw for items and un-anchored objects * Does an attack_hand (paw, animal, etc) for anchored objects * Does nothing to mobs As a default, attack_self_tk does nothing. An attack_self_tk was added to closets to open and close them since that's a common thing. The following items have added attack_tk procs: * Fire axe cabinet, extinguisher cabinet, and bedsheet bin will drop into their square instead of putting it in your hand * Doors only open telekinetically if they require no access * Chairs will rotate if nobody is buckled to them * Filing cabinets will remove a paper at random. * Tables and racks return to prevent telehulk smash This is INCOMPLETE. Adding proper TK interaction to everything is something best done in pieces. In particular, interacting with mobs and items both open up the floodgates for bugs, so we/I need to decide how we want it to go before we commit, and then fix bugs along the way. Stumbling forward, fixing bugs, and then changing course halfway would be a bad idea.
 Timing adjustments attack_self use should be somewhat more standard; previously the activate object verb (and pagedown) had no delay at all. Lowers the time taken when interacting with things on your person or in your square.
 Reverts a change made redundant by #1217 rebasing accidentally made two copies of the function in living.dm, removes the ones I added.
 Adds an alt-click to vents for mobs that can ventcrawl. Reorganizes the ventcrawl code to be a little flatter. Removes the attack_animal default from slime attacks. Apparently some code had assumptions about animals and I don't want to get into what that all is yet.
 Fixes NOBLUDGEON flag Apparently bitflags only work for up to 32768; bitflag 4 SEEMS unused so I have commandeered it. Also, it apperas the TABLEPASS flag (as distinct from passflags PASSTABLE) does absolutely nothing, but I am not going to remove it here.
 Adds click delay to item quick buttons. Updates changelog.
 Click code rework Fixes #646, #579, #863 Completely redoes the click code. Moves all click related code into code/_onclick for reference. Also moves hud datum code and all the screen object code I could find into code/_onclick/hud, as it is related. Item attack(), attackby(), afterattack(), and attack_self() have been moved into item_attack.dm for consistency. Completely removes dummy objects and adds atom.Adjacent(user). This proc checks for border items and anything marked with throwpass for determining whether or not you can reach a given square. A turf helper, ClickCross(), was added to facilitate this. Removes the monolithic Atom.Click() proc in favor of an overridable click handler attached to mobs. Click code no longer uses the : path operator as a consequence, and mob/lastDblClick has been moved to Client/next_click. A few end arounds were necessary (screen objects, buildmode, and spells), but this has been handled by repurposing Atom.Click(); if you have special click code, insert it in the object's Click() function and return 1 to prevent normal processing. This update adds support for attack_ghost(); the previous "new" click handler had support for it but was never finished. I have taken the liberty of letting ghosts click portals, the gateway, and the teleporter to jump to the intended target square, and kept the previous default action of examine()ing every damn thing you click. It is to be suggested that you could do more with this proc when ghost interactions are enabled. This update also adds support for double clicking. It is currently only used for ghosts and AIs, because the original (first) click still registers normally. For both of these, double clicking a square will jump you to it, and double clicking a mob will follow it. In the case of ghosts, double clicking bots and the singularity will also set you following it; if you double click your own corpse, you will re-enter it; this also works if your body is in a closet, sleeper, DNA scanner, etc. Default mobs ignore double clicks as normal. -- NOTE -- There are two flags which were previously unused or misused by click code: USEDELAY and NODELAY. Ostensibly, USEDELAY would double the normal 1sec delay, and NODELAY would remove it. Using either of these flags as intended would significantly affect the timing of the game. In particular, USEDELAY is currently applied to guns and about everything else that acts at range. I am adding USEDELAY as a half-second increase for now, but I have not put a significant amount of thought into it. I considered lowering the normal 1sec delay to .8sec to balance it, but the consequences of that on combat involve more calculations than I care to make. NODELAY seems to never have been used, and I did not implement it, but I could do so trivially.
 Typo fix for a comment in event.dm.
 Changes the wormholes event to place all wormholes on the station, rather than across the entire z-level. You can now click on a wormhole to jump through it (to aid people stuck in grilles with wormholes adjacent).
 Changes radiation storms to have a 10-20 tick delay, to give people time to shelter in maintenance, which now protects you from radiation!
 Initial Event Rework Adds anomalies, special effects which tie into the event system. Ports bholes into an anomaly, cleans up their code. Adds new gravitational anomalies. Imagine a trampoline. Flux event is now an anomaly. Adds a new pyro anomaly.
 Forgot that one of the computers had changed some icon names. Heres the dmi i forgot.
 Cleans up computer code severely. fixes issue #1004. Aliens and Monkeys can now smash computers. However, this only applies to computers with buildable circuit boards. Computers without boards are now impervious to attack and deconstruction(can't steal atmos computers or slash up the escape shuttle computer). Hologram computer has been moved to unused. It has some interesting ideas, but it needs sprites and fix up.
 Updated Rampant Brand Intelligence. The type of origin machine is now announced, and if every vending machine is infected before the origin is stopped, then all infected machines will either rise up, or blow up, with a 60% of the former.

 Mostly behind the scenes changes to how gamemodes are chosen. Antags that are unrelated to the jobs and malfunctioning AI (Malf, Blob, Nuke, Wizard) are now chosen prior to job selection. This means you will have an equal chance to be a malf. AI if you have that turned on (Fix to issue 1127). Fix to rare cases in which you would have a game start with less then three head revs or cultists (game will go back to lobby in this case). People jobbanned from a certain antag position are now never considered for it. can_start() is no longer directly called if the mode is secret since get_runnable_modes() does that for you anyway. Added a message for admins if forcing the secret game mode was not successful.

 Reworked the equation so that you gain a constant cooldown reduction per rank Additionally all spells can now use all 5 spell points now (though the functionality to have spells that don't follow this rule is still there). The new variable "cooldown_min" defines (in deciseconds) what the cooldown should be if all 5 spell points are used on it. For example if you had a 100 charge_max and a 60 cooldown_min, every rank used on that spell would reduce charge_max by 10 Specifics of how the cooldown is affected for each spell has been commented in

 Sec hailer mask ** NOT READY ** **** This only up for a code review, it isn't ready for merging yet, I'm waiting for the finished sprites, for now its using the standard gas mask as a placeholder **** * Problem: People complain about sec silently stunning and cuffing them, sec complains that if they stop to ask someone to surrender they sanic off. * Solution: This commit creates a special security gasmask. As well as functioning as a normal gas mask it has an integrated loud hailer which when activated (via attack self, verb, or action button (which means both hands are free (which means it'll actually get used unlike a hand-hailer))) emits a random compliance phrase, both as a sound effect and in the chat window. You can download the sound effects here: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/95696802/Commits/secmask/oggshq.rar Compliance phrases are: 01. HALT! HALT! HALT! HALT! 02. Stop right there, criminal scum! 03. Freeze, Scum Bag! 04. Dead or alive you're coming with me. 05. God made today for the crooks we could not catch yesterday. 06. Don't move, Creep! 07. Down on the floor, Creep! 08. Prepare for justice! 09. Running will only increase your sentence. 10. Compliance is in your best interest 11. Stop in the name of the Law. // Phrases past this point require the user to tamper with the device via a screwdriver 12. Stop or I'll bash you. 13. Go ahead, make my day. 14. Stop breaking the law, ass hole. 15. You have the right to shut the fuck up. 16. Shut up crime! 17. Face the wrath of the golden bolt. 18. I am, the LAW! -Replaced the Oggs with higher quality ones, they were hard to hear in game -Reorganised the groupings of phrases from 2 groups to three (good cop, bad cop, and shitcurity) -Expanded the restrictor, user can now select an option to only play the good cop phrases. Also added a 'secret' way to make the mask only play shitcurity phrases Added the finished sprites (Credit goes to Iatots for the sprites, though I did some tweaks) Added the masks to the lockers: -HoS has a choice between command Blue, and White -Warden has Red -Officers have black -Detective, HoP, and Captain get fuck all Moved security belts higher up the stack, having to shift through the stuff I'd end up putting in my belt all the time was just annoying.

 Update mind.dm
 Tome rework. Tomes reworked for user friendliness! A fairly large change to cult. Tomes no longer make you choose from a list of words three times to form a rune. Tomes now use the "notes" section to decide whether you can scribe a rune or not, once you've translated the appropriate words into english, the usable runes will be in the list when you choose scribe rune, it will scribe the appropriate word that you translated. I.E. If "Ire" was translated to "join", the first word will be "ire". This removes researching words. Though, it's still possible to do by changing words in your notes, it's slower, and using an incorrect rune now does overall damage 75 to the user, so "testing" the runes you make with incorrect words will potentially kill the user. Hopefuly this will keep people from actually trying to research. On top of removing research (Which people found annoying and or too easy.), converting people now gives you a word, so this hopefully makes cult rounds more involved for all sides, because cultists need to convert a couple people before they can start using their full arsenal of runes, instead of fucking off into space for 20 minutes before anything happens. As well, choosing a rune from a list means you no longer need to memorize word combinations, and you can't mess up by clicking the wrong second/third word by accident.
 Runes.dm updated for tome rework. Convert now gives a guaranteed rune word to the cultist that converts.
 Cult.dm updated for tome rework No longer give 2 words per cultist at round start, back to original 1 word per.

 Added TemplatesGuide.txt, with info on the templating system.
 Black slime extract now inflicts a disease that turns the victim into a slime after a short while instead of immediately turning them through the chem itself. This gives people a chance to call out over radio about what happened if they were the victim of a drive-by sliming. Likewise it gives them a faint hope of reversing the process with the cure, frost oil (in the code frost oil is hilariously toxic to slimes). Source of frost oil are botany and (irony) xenobio. The disease is fast spreading, and infected are likely to only have 30 seconds to a minute to find frost oil, but it's highly effective once taken. On the plus side for xenobiologists this allows for them to place black slime extract in things (medibots, food) without it becoming immediately apparent to victims what's been sabotaged. This disease cannot be spread in any fashion besides black slime extract. (Because that would be so hideously broken if it was transmittable) The flavor texts for the stages are an allusion to nethack, where the process of getting slimed is much the same (http://nethack.wikia.com/wiki/Sliming) One other feature of note: mutant slime people retain the old black slime extract behavior, getting slimed almost immediately after exposure. This means that you can replicate pre-pull black extract by creating a mixture of equal parts black and green extract.
 Some reason it pushed the old one...?
 Fixes href exploit in borgs, now improved because the last one was kinda silly
 Juggernaut Adjustments After finally seeing Juggernauts in action (seeing two of them rape a full escape shuttle) I've realised their laser reflection is a bit much. -Raised the reflection chance to 80% from 65% -BUT- -Instead of the reflection nullifying the damage entirely the juggernaut takes half the projectile damage -Adjusted the weighting on the reflection trajectory, the intention was meant to be more "ooo sparkley light show, oops sorry dude over there" than "I shoot you, I die"

 Cargo Bay: Exile Implants I forgot to add these the first time around.
 Created female uniforms are now cached for everyone upon creation, so the blending process can only happen once per uniform type. The blending process itself has been optimized and no longer relies on SwapColor. In order to avoid image "blinking" upon laying down/standing up for the first time upon initial icon creation the uniform layers will momentarily be swapped. This swapping allows both blended sprites to be momentarily "seen" (which allows the blend proc to generate them) removing the blink effect. The swap occurs as quickly as possible, and should never actually appear swapped on the client screen. This effect is only required by and used for initial icon creation, and is not used for the loading of cached blended icons, which makes up the bulk of uniform operations.

 Uniforms now fit differently on women than men. These changes are made to reflect the differences between the male and female character sprites. This pull exists mainly to delineate women and men more clearly since I've seen a lot of female crew members getting called dude all the time. This is accomplished by a special uniform, "female", that removes the few pixels that don't exist on the female sprite but do on the male sprite (on which all clothing is modeled). The net effect is subtle, but effective. Women actually look like women now, as opposed to dudes with a near imperceptible blush. Besides "female" there are no new sprites in this pull, all "female versions" are generated by taking the default outfit and removing those pixels. These pixels don't reveal skin, they're literally just covering void. To keep certain unique outfits from looking weird with this, a blacklist var for the effect has been created in "fitted", which tracks if an outfit looks like a standard jumpsuit and defaults to 1. This effect only changes uniforms. Some exosuits can still hide these details very well through there coverage. http://i.imgur.com/Kzx6JyT.png

Objects are reflected like ablative currently does. modifies the bullet_act of humans to incorporate this new system gives the ablative armor the same chance to reflect it had before gives dualsabers if wielded and the user is not a hulk a 100% chance to reflect energy projectiles adds specific wield() and unwield() to dualsabers in order to add check if hulk

 Tweaks Damage Values
 Twohanded weapon's offhand item will count as a shield if the weapon itself is a shield.
 Adds a fix for 2x1 (glass_large) airlocks. These doors didn't work previously, as the bound width needs to be set properly. Additionally, LINDA was tweaked to properly update in the case of multitile objects such as this door (actually this door is the only such, currently, but if more doors or other multi-tile objects are added, this will help) Note that until #1206 is merged, this door has a blind spot where you cannot click it because you are not in range of the leftmost tile; old click code only uses the canonical location (loc), meaning the right tile is not counted for range checks.

 Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/tgstation/-tg-station into emotes-rework
 Revised.
 Start of standardizing required permissions for admins. Using the dropdown menu / changing health / names of people in view variables now actually requires +VAREDIT. Shuttle moving moved from +FUN to +ADMIN for convenience sake. +ADMIN now required to view antagonists / law changes, before it was only required to check antags via verbs, which you could get around through the secrets menu. +ADMIN Also now required to view all of the special information given about players in who menu (like antagonist status), but all admins can still see stealth keyed admins.
 Emote rework, invalid emotes are passed to ..(), slimes and cyborgs exempt When an emote fails the switch check for a mob, it calls ..(act). New files in mob/living and mob/living/carbon with associated procs that handle these invalid emotes from higher emote calls. If invalid on mob/living, mob/living will show the invalid emote dialog. Slimes, Cyborgs, and MMIs do not call ..() on fail.
 Fixed issue with links/buttons not working until first update.
 Merge pull request #1166 from Carn/admin_ranks Fixes #1147 (type-mismatch) +features
 There are now 2 in main outpost, 1 in each mini outpost.
 Removed pointless code in communicate rune. Removed code that didn't need to be there, changed usr to user as per Giaco's recommendation.
 Update runes.dm
 Added Nano UI Chemistry Dispenser. Fixed UI update issue with non auto-updating UIs. Misc tweaks for CSS and JS for UI styling.
 Changes a few runes for ease of use and making useless runes mildly useful. Teleport Other no longer requires 3 cultists standing around it to use, can not teleport user. Communicate rune no longer deletes on first use, talismans still do. Free Cultist no longer requires 3 cultists to use. (This rune was pretty useless, and still is. Should probably replace it.)

 Merge pull request #1234 from Sishen1542/master Muzzle and spear sprite edits.
 * Fixes ghosts being able to deploy bombs. * Upgraded the nuclear interface to the new style.
 Added three newscasters to main mining outpost: One in hallway, one in lounge area, one in ore smelting area. Added one each in the equipment rooms of the other two outposts.
 Added newscasters to the mining outspost, one in each of the two smaller ones, three in the bigger starter one. Where da news at?
 Reagent fix: Mercury now causes brain loss. Ethylredoxane now removes ethanol from a mob. Space cleaner no longer removes overlays. Most dirts and spots are /obj/effect/decal/cleanable's anyways.
 Fixes attached voice analysers not listening The voice analyser will listen to the keyword now even when not secured (enabling it to be directly used on grenade casings and tank transfer valves). Adds missing related proc to tank transfer valve.
 Muzzle and spear sprites fixed.
 Adds missing pug icon states, adds some misc pug behaviour stuff Signed-off-by: Cael_Aislinn <cael_aislinn@yahoo.com.au>
 Adds critter crates Fixed several conflicts present in last pull request, should be fine now. All animals ordered through cargo will arrive in critter crates. These crates are designed for the safe transport of animals. Critter crates can only be unlocked from the outside and automatically lock when closed. You can resist your way out of the crates. Critter crates are counted as normal crates when sent back to CentComm. Adds cat crate (cost: 40 points). Corgi crate now has a 50-50% chance of either containing a male or female corgi. Moves critter crate sprites from storage.dmi to closet.dmi. Removes redundant large animal crates.
 Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/tgstation/-tg-station
 Nano now handles Topic for the src_object, allowing it to only allow interactions with UIs that have a "STATUS_INTERACTIVE" status/visibility. Small tweaks to the Cryo topic.
 Nano UI Framework updates. * Nano UIs now "work" with AI and Cyborgs. * Visibility updates (now uses line of sight). * Added displayBar() template helper for displaying progress/health bars. * Added new health bars to Nano UI Cryo. * Added Eject Occupant to Nano UI Cryo.

 Adds EMP implant. Replaced the EMP grenades from the uplink with an EMP kit. The kit contains a grenade, an implant and a flashlight with 5 uses that can EMP any object or mob in melee range.
 Adds a special flashlight that can be used five times to directly inflict strong EMP on an object or mob at close range.
 Randmutb will no longer select and mutate RACEBLOCK - mutagen, cloning, radiation-events etc will no longer cause this block to change. IsBanned() now only processes the key into a ckey once...rather than several times.
 Made all unsimulated/wall turfs have block_air = 1 instead of only the fakeglass walls
 The auto-notes which are added when a ban is applied won't cause logs.
 Admin Log Tweaks -Wire cut logs are now accessed via the Investigate verb, instead of popping up in the admin chat log. -Wizard Fireball explosions no longer create admin chat log messages either. -Adding and removing Player Notes is now logged. -The note that is added automatically to people who get banned, now displays the duration of ban.
 Fixed issue with Nano UI windows taking seconds to load. Removed user << browse_rsc() entries as they caused the delay. New assets (stylesheets, scripts, templates and images) have to be added to the client's send_resources proc or they will not exist on the client.
 Added comments to the airlock to help prevent this happening in the future.
 The APC's extra Topic() parameter was causing a runtime to occur when you used ..(). Fixed it by removing the parameter and re-arranging the code so it wasn't required. Fixes Issue #1148.

 Moving a check so the color choice window doesnt pop up if there's no power
 PDA Painter Machine -Adds the PDA painter, which lets you change the appearance of the inserted PDA. Good for job-changes and possibly traitor disguises? -Cleans up pda.dmi, moves the ai card and pai device sprites to their own .dmi. PDA box sprite moved to storage.dmi where it belongs.

 Replaces the default gunshot sound effect with four higher quality ones. Replaces the laser sound effect with an arguably better one.
 removed extra newline
 Added delay to Disposals sound Fixed mining (and disposals) being a noise hazard. Their sound shouldn't 'pile' up now like before.
 Merge pull request #1102 from Aranclanos/Linda Linda.

 Stops idle syndicate mobs from destroying surroundings Adds a variable ('idle_env_destroyer') to all hostile mobs, denoting whether the mob destroys it's environment while idling or not. Default value is 0 (no). Syndicate, russian and pirate mobs are affected. Also prevents aforementioned mobs from suiciding and/or wrecking away mission environments before the player could see them. Fixes hostile mobs interpreting 'null' as a valid target and always being in HOSTILE_ATTACK stance.

 Fixes #1147 - type-mismatch Added helper: /proc/findchar(haystack, needles, start=1, end=0) works like findtext except it finds the first occurrence of one of the characters from the needles string, within haystack. Permissions can now be removed as well as added, by replacing the + with a -. e.g. +BAN adds bans permissions, -BAN removes them. This applies to admin_ranks.txt and the permissions panel. Verb overrides are now possible for admins_ranks. Specific verbs can be forced-on, or forced-off via keywords like +/client/proc/mimespeak or -/client/verb/ooc. This applies both to admin_ranks.txt and the permissions panel. SQL system is not compatible. admin_ranks are now datums. This means admin_ranks actually behave more like permission groups as intended. When you temporarily modify an admin's permissions via the permissions panel, their rank_name is appended with "([ckey])". This prevents modifications to their rights affecting everyone. admin rank names now support - _ and @ characters (since ckeyEx() does not strip these). SQL permissions system was modified. SQL databases will have to be updated or they will no longer work. WARNING: admin_ranks.txt and admins.txt format has changed slightly! You will need to redo those txt files!
 [MAP] Air/Airless Cleanup -Fixes aired/airless turf mixing -- Most at the mining asteroid alien base, and a few stray tiles at the derelict and telecomms satellite. -The little hydroponics room in the mining asteroid has its hydroponics trays removed.

 Helper proc /proc/find_record(field, value, list/L) It will search list/L for a /datum/data/record with fields[field] == value, and return it. This removes a vast amount of copypasta (there's still so much left in there though). It also removes all the locate(\ref[record]) I could find, which were normal used with topic(), meaning it was susceptible to abuse. Secbots, ed209s and turrets are now smarter with their record-checks. They now prefer to use our face-name rather than id-name. ICly, this is the bot using facial recognition. This fixes an issue where it'd try to use the name variable which could be in the format "Unknown (as their id name)" when they were disfigured, etc. causing record-lookup to fail. Additionally, these bots will treat those without a valid record in the security database, to be treated like criminals.

 * Cleaned up chameleon projector code. * Added a Del() to the projection which will disrupt the chameleon projector, before being deleted by acid or a drill (killing the person inside). * Made chameleon projectors disrupt if moved from the hand, to make it consistent. Currently you could put them in pockets but if you picked them up it would disrupt. Fixing this would involve changing all use of dropped() so instead I made them disrupt when equipped and, due to how dropped() works, when they switch hands. Lowered the disrupt cooldown to make up for this.

 - In an effort to decrease the number of unneeded client connections, I've made it so when the round ends, all the clients who are in the lobby get kicked before the restart. This is only effective when rounds end 'organically' (not when restart commands or votes are used, for example). The intention is to prevent people from leaving their computers on and connected indefinitely, because all clients contribute to the total. The assumption is that if you are in the lobby when the round ends, you have not participated in the previous round, meaning you are probably not actually present. - Also added a button to the player panel, which allows admins to do the same thing. The admin's name is reported to all the kicked clients.

 -Updated the changelog with the atmos hardsuit.
 Further Ling Tweaks -Fixes a bug where a changeling could use revive after being husked by another changeling. The husk also loses his absorb points to the changeling that ate him. -Fixes some objective text to use appropriate cases when dealing with numbered objectives ("1 genome", "2 genomes", so on) -Resonant shriek now acts as a "flash" for cyborgs in range, giving changelings an in my opinion much-needed anti-silicon ability. Changelings in the area will also be able to hear the shriek. -Spread Infestation requires fewer DNA absorptions now, but costs more chems to use and creates 1 fewer spiders.

 Major refactor of AI upload modules to not be dependent on the upload computers. Modules can just run install(target,user) and everything will work fine. Upload computers cleaned up quite heavily. Less copy+paste. Removed that pointless "Open access panel" verb they had. Law changing procs moved from mob/living/silicon/robot and mob/living/silicon/ai to mob/living/silicon. This means clear_inherent_laws(), add_inherent_law(), etc. This is what the new file is for. Doesn't change anything since they both had exact copies of the same procs. NOTE: This commit doesn't change the maps, so don't checkout to this without the next one.
 Replaced organ helper procs with a single more versatile and strealined one.
 Renamed variables: b_type to blood_type h_color to hair_color f_color to facial_hair_color f_style to facial_hair_style h_style to hair_style

 * Added the atmos hardsuit to the map. * Removed the rad protection from the atmos hardsuit.

 Merge pull request #1045 from Ricotez/master Added an Atmospherics Hardsuit.
 Removes the hashnames from humans turned monkey (Attempt the third) This deals with humans using ling powers or DNA injectors to become things like "Monkey (42A0)" and such Calling out over the radio "LOOK FOR THE MONKEY WITH THE FOUR LETTER NAME/NAME WITH LETTERS IN IT" is shitty and meta. Humans shouldn't be able to tell at a glace that a monkey is actually a player unless it ACTS like a player. Let people try some reverse Turing test shit and mimic a computer controlled monkey. Note: This is a remake of an earlier request (#1028) that was in ITSELF a remake of an even earlier request (#1003). I am sorry for burning these numbers.
 -Added in-hand sprites for the atmospherics hardsuit. -Dropped the radiation protection of the atmospherics hardsuit from 75, what engineering hardsuits have, to 50, what all other hardsuits have (except for CE). -Added fire protection to the atmospherics hardsuit (equal to that of the CE and firesuits).
 * Adds checks in the paperwork module topics. Fixing the exploit that would allow you to teleport anything.

The stats of the Atmospherics Hardsuit are equal to those of the Engineering Hardsuit, so the differences are purely cosmetic in nature. It lets mappers distinguish between hardsuits assigned to Engineering and Atmospherics.

They'll probably keep it in a jar on a shelf, the sickos. -Chance to get a Survive objective removed. -Changes the objective text to prevent confusion. Minor ability cost changes. Fleshmend no longer heals toxin damage (that's covered by Panacea!)
 * Added a client check to revheads and heads, when checking for victory conditions. Having a clientless revhead or head will count them as dead. * Made sure the check_rev_victory() checked only for mutiny objectives, otherwise anymore custom objectives will cause the game to never end.
 Removes the huge damage taken from monkey <--> human transformations (40 brute and 20 tox) This is a big part of why unstable mutagen attacks are so ridiculously effective. This damage is taken on top of any additional tox damage the chem is giving you, which is significant in itself.

 Some standarization for disposals. Added a spawn(0) before the flush() call on their process() proc because flush() includes some sleeps. You can actually restart the MC on a specific way. The new air for disposals will be created AFTER the air is transfered to the holder, avoiding runtimes and making this feature actually work. Removed a hacky check on process() to avoid this runtime.

 Standarization for the candle code and now the process() of it will remove the candle from a mob properly when the wax runs out, avoiding a runtime.
 Removed the location change and dropped() call from the throw_item() proc. These thingies are already handled by u_equip(), who is called. This will fix some runtimes if an item is deleted on their dropped()

[r]" //END COPY PASTE Start the game, run 'give allrights', which doesn't give all rights, but some of the rights. 128 and 131072 are missing. Then you can either run 'hasright' to check whether you have the permissions that correspond to a user defined number, or you can run 'checkrights' to check for all 31 theoretical permissions.

 Blob/AI cameras can now be followed by ghosts. Added the blob to the check antagonists, displaying how many blobs are left to win and being able to show the player panel for the blob. Gave overminds mind datums which will initialize to give the overmind a blob special role. Re-worded the BE ALIEN candidate so that it is more abstract and could mean becoming a blob. Added another message for when the infected crew is about to burst into a blob. EMPs will now hurt the blob. Fixed blob spores blocking the blob from expanding. Nodes will also slowly recharge their health. Gave a little bit of health to normal blobs so that lasers don't one shot them anymore, barely.
 Merge pull request #981 from SuperSayu/snack_attack Minor fix omnibus
 Did what I could to make the die/shard code for this not as shitty, as implored and largely written by Aranclanos
 Steping on a D4 without shoes on now acts as if you stepped on glass. I had this idea with the other dice stuff, but dismissed it as silly snowcode that would have just lower my odds of getting it commited. Since several people have asked for this functionality in the time since, here it is.
 Added some dynamic text to the 'you remember x is y' thing
 Cult: Two starting words Heres an experiment I'd like to run for a bit, the first change is the pointless 5 damage from the supply talisman is removed as the only effect it had was meta. (The stun talisman will still do self damage though, its a decent stun so it should have a draw back) The main change is round start cultists get a second word from a second pool, this second pool contains the words that are not in the current round start pool. The reason for this change is that the biggest complaint of cult is that it takes a long time to start as you need to share words between the other cultists, and if the other cultists don't communicate their words (which happens often) you're pretty boned. Cultists starting with two words will allow them to do brute force researching solo if needed, though sharing their words will still massively boot strap their researching.

 Grab fixes and scythe tweaks Fixes the grab timer; there will now be a delay between grab upgrades. Fixes grab process so you no longer have to spam click before it disables itself. Fixes issue #577 Fixes issue #253: Prevents grab and throw when the affected mob is buckled. Prevents tabling a mob when that mob is buckled. Prevents you from dropping scythes on a table or rack if there is a space vine in that square; it will now auto-attack the vine instead. Also auto-attacks vines if you click the floor under them.

 Added the ability to define the ip and computer id for a manual ban (in the banning panel). This is so mirroring bans or banning people who were not online during the round in progress does not require admins to spawn a mob, set their variables and then ban the mob. If however an admin attempts to add a manual ban for a player who was present during the current round, a player who still has a mob somewhere in the game world, the proc will prioritize the mob's ip and computer id variables, not the things entered in the banning panel form.

 -Standardizes purchasePower. -Trims some descriptions that were too long and didn't fit on the text bar. -Adds proper checking to hive DNA download.
 tweaks to the dice: *the dice now all have different colors, to make them easy to tell the difference between them at a glance. *the d2 has been swapped out for a d00, though you can still create a d2 if someone demands it. *the generic pill bottle full of dice has been replaced with a proper dice bag. *actually throwing a die will now cause it to roll until the throw ends, at which point it will state the result of the throw. The old method still works as well. *most new dice have had their sprites edited to be smaller. *minor grammer corrections.
 fixes issues with parrots such as not eating its own cracker and switching icon state while dead

 Merge pull request #856 from Giacomand/reverse_pick Re-added reverse pickpocketing. Resolves #792. Pockets are now seperate
 Converted the old air alarm wires to use the more structured datum wires.
 Changed the projectile code to have a lower probability to hit your target area the further away you are, instead of the further the original target was. This is more logical and makes sense. I also changed how it decides which zone to hit instead, if the random check fails. Fixes #922
 Updated the message you get after trying to analyze the floor.

 Merge pull request #925 from Giacomand/blob_vamp Blob Gamemode Revamp Blob gamemode is back and better than ever. The blob is selected from be_alien candidates and is controled like a real time strategy game.
 Now it is ready. Changed the secret rotation value of the blob game mode to 2, from 0.
 Merge pull request #909 from Intigracy/Cheridanbrokemygit Second try at changing the "Coder Secrets" into "General Secrets"
 Fixed a bug with the revert power leaving behind icon-less blobs. Fixed a typo. Gave a blob_act to simple animals. Increased damage of mecha blob_act().
 Removed the nuke code. You cannot nuke the station anymore. Added a Jump to Node power. Cleaned up the code. Changed some more values. Added a blob_act() to camera. Removed most "if(gamemode == "blob") checks to stop people from using it to metagame. Removed cells exploding when being blob_act()'d
 Shows who the blobs were at the end of the round. Small tweaks to values, such as increasing the resource rate of the core. Overminds will have different names.
 Adds additional dice! Places where the D6 and D20 spawned (the library and perma) now spawn with a dice bottle. Said dice bottles now contains a D2, D4, D8, D10, and D12 in addition to the preexisting D6 and D20 for a richer meta-roleplaying experience. This also fixes an obscure bug where dice could be generated invisible because their initial value was set to 0. Additionally this fixes the grammer of dice descriptions, which were not using the singular "die".
 Fixed two exploits with the biogenerator and the condi/chemmaster

 Merge pull request #920 from Giacomand/revert_compile Reverting NTSL compile times.
 Air Alarm Electronics sprites Nothing fancy, adds some sprites for air alarm electronics so they're not using the airlock electronic sprites. It's an APC module with the circuit board flipped 90 degrees
 Rewrites the DNA-cost limitation to work off of absorbed dna count (the objective tracker) instead of the length of the dna list. Changeling Regeneration now has two steps, so that changelings can decide when to use it rather than popping up after a timer. Fixed an issue with the chem UI indicator showing up for non-lings.
 Missing file.
 Atmos Analyzers added to Atmos -Atmos Techs spawn with an analyzer in their pocket -Added 3 analyzers to the atmos tech's wardrobe -Added Analyzers to the autolathe. They're a little redundant with PDAs having in built atmos analyzers but as an atmos tech I find them clunky to use for wide areas and prefer hand analyzers due to them not taking away focus. Ironically atmospherics had none of these scanners nearby.
 You can now drag your radio to you to open the interface.
 Securitron access to the DETECT cartridge My thinking behind this is ff the detective isn't meant to arrest people himself but is meant to call for back up instead, why not give him access to back up that will actually show up? Also added SecBot access to the Captains for no reason other than he's the Captain and he should be getting his hands dirty. Also is the captain's PDA meant to have access to all pda functions? Because I've noticed theres a few missing.
 * Added the changes into the changelog.

 Disabled disposals auto-routing for packages. For some reason package wrapped objects were set to auto-reroute to disposals, I can't think a good reason for this to happen but i can think of a bad one: people's mail ends up getting lost to a murder room due to someone else's neglect/incompetence - probably one of the main reasons the mail room doesn't get used very often. So what will happen now is that packages that are put on the conveyor without a destination will loop back around and come back out the mail chute until a cargo tech works out how to use a destination tagger
 Merge pull request #932 from Metacide/master Updated MetaStation.v29E.dmm to MetaStation.v31D.dmm
 Updated MetaStation.v29E.dmm to MetaStation.v31D.dmm -Better camera placement in cargo/supply and other places. -Medbay Isolation Rooms are now Patient rooms. -Medbay and Research have been reorganised. -Escape has been enlarged and is now harder to barricade. -Genetics now has patient lockers. -There are now some patient lockers outside the morgue. -Drastic reduction in tinted windows -Some cameras are now better named, such as in break rooms. -3 specialised maint. rooms - bar, surgery, farm. -Added cameras to solar control rooms. -Added donuts in a few places. -Replaced food vendor in bridge with drinks vendor. -Captain's desk in bridge now has access windoor. -Windoors removed in a lot of places, escape too. -Atmospherics no longer has uber-glass windows. -The Theatre now has shutters with a switch. -Adjusted space-bridge. Works better now. -Many other minor fixes and adjustments.
 removed part of the snowflake directory
 The item_action buttons will now recycle themselves, instead of getting deleting each tick to generate new ones. These buttons are the ones top left of the human screen, usually toggling on and off certain items. I expect to reduce 50% the amount of atom/movable/Del() calls with this.
 * Forgot a file.
 Blob revamp! Re-introduced the concept of a player controlling the blob in an RTS fashion, expanding the blob and building structures such as nodes and factories. All blobs will try to find ghosts, with the BE_ALIEN flag, to be the blob overmind. Even random event blobs will try to get players to play as the overmind. Added a /mob/camera that is now being used by the AI eye and the blob overmind. It is a mob that isn't dead but acts as a camera for the player, to be controlled by something like the AI or the blob. There are now a resource currency for the blob to spend it's points on blob expansion and upgrades. Added a small blob_act to mechs. Made all camera mobs max invisibility. Because of this I removed the AI best friend button as it would be not working. Blob mode will send a normal intercept report.
 - You now cannot talk to voices in your head directly. Go mad ramblings! - Fixes two procs that had mob/dead/observer as pathname - Added a helper proc to create voices.dm
 reverted changes to headset.dm. Parrots can no longer hear headsets.

 Fixed heaters being invisible when spawned using buildmode, changed their sprites to the heater sprites instead of the freezer sprites. De-capitalized heaters and freezers.
 The mop will now check for water to clean the floor. This will stop people from cleaning the floor with fuel, avoiding the slippery floors.
 Changed the response_harm var from spiders and bears from "pokes" to "hits" Those were some really strong pokes... Fixes #687
 Windows have a new proc, can_be_reached(), it will check if there's an object blocking the way on the turf if a mob clicks on the window. It will make some pretty dir checks and then use CanPass(). And before it starts, it checks if it's a full tile window too.
 Burns to Burn, to be more consistent.
 Updated the health analyser interface to be more usable. Cleaned up the code. Removed the copy and paste of the PDA medical scanner. Removed monkey gamemode checks. Removed the unused PDA detective scanning code.
 Fixed heaters being invisible when spawned using buildmode, changed their sprites to the heater sprites instead of the freezer sprites. Capitalized the first letter in Heater because else it looks stupid.

 makes crackers garbage collect, and parrots drop crackers when they don't drop it gently. added a directory of parrot snowflake code Parrots can now hear from their headsets! Fixed a problem with parrots not taking damage from simple animals. Rest in peace, robust god. tweaks parrots a tiny bit, fixes most of the oversights that nodrak pointed out. fixes a ton of stuff with parrots and also some stuff with simple animals parrots now eat crackers parrots now use attack_animal instead of snowflake attack code parrots toggle between harmless and aggressive, player parrots can do this with a verb player parrots can use headsets but cannot hear their headsets. simple_animals now return after using healing items on them, they will also ignore ointment as simple animals only take brute damage.
 Cheridan broke my git the first time, here's try #2! Makes the "coder secrets" in secrets panel become general secrets for all admins. Adding myself to admins.txt for test server purposes, in case I ever forget to change it again. Reasons: It's very helpful to use the admin log for a quick glance to see who spawned the mateba for the clown, rather than open the serverlog to check. Plus I see no reason why it should be restricted to coders, considering it's not really at all able to affect the game by admins seeing it.

 Using the quick_equip() verb will no longer make you drop your item. It will also stop udpdating all your HUD, instead, it will only update the overlay of your active hand. All other HUD and overlay updates are already handled on the item movements. If there's no slot available it will show the "You are unable to equip that" message. Fixes #713
 Modified the checks that the pulsed wires do on APCs after the spawn() timer finishes. They will now react properly regarding if the wires are cut or not.
 Light bulbs will first drop on the floor before being picked up. Because of the TK grab object on their hand, TK users will be unable to pick up the light bulb and it will stay on the floor.

The destination tag is still the same. -Moved around some things in robotics, welding goggles are more visible. -Corrected CentComm transit shuttle positioning in arrivals - it now lands properly without a space gap. -Rearranged dorms to be three tiles wide -Altered the Lawyer's Office, it is now more accessible in line with Miggles' suggestion, and also larger. -Fixed broken disposals north of Medbay, and in the Medbay break room. The whole disposals loop works again. -Removed unneeded disposals pipes by the gateway room. -Removed glass around cargo disposals conveyor to stop window-hitting spam. -Fixed single space tile in the Janitor's Closet. -Medbay security office has correct access level rather than all-access. -Added airlock entry to Research, as in boxstation. -Added a good few fire-fighting lockers in public areas -Many other small bug fixes.

 Syndicate Bomb Tweaks Syndicate bombs are now structures rather than items. This means they cannot be hidden in lockers and disposals anymore. They also can no longer be used as grenades by crafty traitors. They now audibly beep as their timer counts down, which is a visible display that can be seen when examined.
 The attack() of cigarette packets is now updated to the storage procs and stuff. It will pick the first object of the contents instead of creating a new cigarette and generating issues.
 AIs can interact with fire doors AIs can now open and close fire doors if they are powered and unwelded. This is done so the AI could more freely manipulate the doors without needing to use a fire alarm each time. It would let them seal off areas without triggering the annoying alarm, and also let them close firedoors that one guy with a crowbar opened up.
 -Fixed mining dock door being all-access -Added a darker floor for the HoP office to make it stand out more. -Replaced a bunch of computers on centcom with fake structures -Replaced some dead-end doors on centcom with fake turfs. Muh fourth wall!
 Updated the type of radio that Ian accepts, I changed it a while ago to reduce it lag so now Ian is rejecting it.
 Removed the sleep(10) on the New() of the turrets. This will stop the exploit of making several turrets by spamming the last step on the turret construction. The cover of the turret will also spawn at the New() of the turrets, instead of waiting for the next process() tick. Fixes all the lack of sprite updates while constructing a turret and added the "you need two sheets of metal" message that Rolan7 made on his pull request. (which I'm closing muahaha)

 Fixes ShowInterface() using usr instead of user. Thanks MrPerson. Also added a pause to the end of both mapmerge batch files, to stop them autoclosing when doubleclicked (and hence hiding errors).
 Holodeck computers will use power_change() now, who will call their emergencyShutdown() proc. This will make the holodeck shut down if the power of the area dies. Added a check on the emergencyShutdown to see if the holodeck area is already empty. Removed the unused togglePower() proc of the holodeck computer.
 Removed the emp_act() of humans, mob/living has a better one. This will stop EMPs affecting twice items on humans.
 * Detective scanner can receive more detail from blood reagents. * Detective scanner no longer scans the reagents of mobs.
 2 new AI sprites. Added Red October AI Core sprite. Added Xeno Queen AI Hologram sprite. Modified AI code so players can use the new sprites.
 Removed all the spawn(0) from bump code and the special check for turfs that rolan7 made a while ago on the mob different Bump() procs. Added a special check on move() code, only when you're pulling something. If the loc of what you're pulling is the same after you moved, you'll execute the pulling. Otherwise you'll stop pulling. This is to avoid pushing something that you're pulling and moving it back, looking like you didn't do anything. This was "handled" by the spawn(0) procs. Reworked cyborg recharge stations, they aren't part of the death() and Bump() procs of cyborgs and they act like lockers. Click them to open them and again to close them. Added a sprite for when it's closed with no occupant inside (it's just the closed sprite with red lights instead of a blinking green light).

 Quick fix to a smoke runtime.
 Merge pull request #851 from Carn/Issue830 Resolves #830 - ghost_form is only selectable by members.
 Remote resources support. There is now a PRELOAD_RSC define in code/_compile_options.dm. Setting it to 0 will allow you to use on-the-fly rsc downloads, or the new remote rsc features. Normally (PRELOAD_RSC == 1) the game will send you all the resources for the game that existed at compile time, this is the long-delay before joining the game...but it means that the game isn't sluggish later on due to trying to download icons and such. Which is good, but uses a lot of bandwidth. On-the-fly behaviour (PRELOAD_RSC == 0) is when the game only downloads icons when you see something for the first time...this is often responsible for things being briefly invisible on slow connections. Remote RSC behaviour (PRELOAD_RSC == 0 and some urls defined in config/external_rsc_urls.txt), is a mixture of the two above behaviours. It allows you to connect without downloading lots of resources immediately. However, once you connect it will select a url from a list of urls which hold zipped up copies of the tgstation.rsc. This allows the load of downloading those large files to be distributed across a few cheap web-servers or free upload sites...whilst the main game-server is freed up for other stuff. Should preloading from a remote url fail, behavior will revert to on-the-fly.
 Resolves #677 - Overwriting a buffer now works correctly (you no longer have to clear it first). This was due to a bad link (one missing '=' after the buffer's num parameter.

It previously had the values of gas set low and an approximation of what the values should be. The temperature was also extremely low. This pull sets the values to the default of the other floor tiles. Arrivals will become cold randomly, but not every round. The epicenter of this coldness is the plaque (thanks to dumpdavid for helping us figure it out). It is a map edited floor tile, it is the exact same as every other tile except it has its values edited on the map. I am not sure if this will fix arrivals getting cold, but the values of the tile are an anomaly and should be reverted to the default values. Map-merger died. Had to merge by hand. Code by Zelacks
 Fixes engiborgs deleting their own welder by creating a flamethrower. The attackby() of flamethrowers can lead to flamethrower_screwdriver() and flamethrower_rods(). Two new procs that handle the creation of a flamethrower. New object /obj/item/weapon/weldingtool/largetank/cyborg. This new object does nothing on the flamethrower creation procs. I'm not entirely happy about this.

 Resolves #830 - ghost_form is only selectable by members. ghost_form is now saved with other preferences. Public visibility of memberships is toggable and saved with other preferences. ooc-colors for admins and members are now sanitized. Bright colours like Yellow, white and baby-blue will be darkened for the sake of legibility. Related to above - added helper procs to convert between RGB and HSL colour models. Admins cannot modify var/unlock_content without +DEBUG rights. unlock_content moved from client into prefs. Player savefile version number updated - this will trigger savefile updates, no data should be lost.
 Removed the in_range() check and made the ID card drop on the floor and then call for verb_pickup(). The user will be the one who clicked the button, of course. It looks weird so maybe it should be better to move the verb to a mob proc and make the verb call for that proc. Afaik this verb was never used like this, I would like to hear opinions. Specially from gia~

 Monkeys will now handle storage items like humans. It will be highly noticeable on clicking your backpack while it's on your back slot. It will actually open the contents instead of moving the backpack to your hand without a sound. Aliens are not included to this change.
 Added back the "!reinforce" sprite, used for medium grabs (it's a shitty gray sprite saying UP-GRADE with a blue X). If anyone wants to make better sprites for it, go ahead. As for now, it was missing and one type of grab was invisible on your hand.
 Added a distance check for when you remove an ID of the HoP's computer. If failed, it drops on the computer's location, just like a borg or AI interaction.

 Finally finished adding double-toy-swords, emagged double-toy-swords, and improved some of the earlier fixes. Swords no longer have to be turned off before emagging, the player-sprite overlay will update correctly now.
 Fixes monkeyVsFoodProcessor properly - blood buckets are now created with dna. Removes unused code in /obj/structure/mecha_wreckage/gygax/New()
 Changed a Fix Just making a list is good enough to prevent the runtime.
 Fixes various runtimes Runtimes created when trying to apply radiation to a mob destroyed by monkeyizing, trying to add different components to lists of salvage, attacking non-carbon mobs with lighters, and blending monkies in the food processor.
 Pulsing the bolt light wire with a multitool will now update the sprite of the airlock.
 Added admin logs for mechs. Fixed the mech sleeper sprite. The logs are: Mob logs for clamp, drill and "empty" hits, and syringe gun and sleeper injected reagents. Also all the different ranged guns. Added an admin notice and server log for the honkerblast, wormwhole generator and gravity catapult. These notices have a quick jump to mob, admin-PM and (?) button. They are pretty cool.

 Merge pull request #819 from AlexanderUlanH/projectile Changed atom's bullet_act to call the projectile's on_hit, and changed most bullet_acts to call on_hit as well. Removed some now-unnecessary snowflake code. These changes will make projectiles which should effect non-mobs, such as the gyrojet and the ion rifle, work properly. Inanimate objects can now be empulsed with the ion rifle, whose projectiles used to dissipate on hitting anything but a mob. Gyrojets now explode on most objects, as opposed to just on walls and mobs, and the snowflake code that made them work on walls is no longer necessary. The code for pulse rifles' breaking walls has been moved from a check in turf to a check in pulse beams, and has been expanded to include structures, allowing them to (slowly) break girders. For coders, it means that on_hit is a reliable proc for the effect of a bullet's hitting an object. While it does mean a number of needless procs of on_hit, it's not too much more proccing than is already done by the gun code, and the removal of the snowflake code that was used to mask the issue, such as the two checks every time a shot hit a wall, should mostly if not more than offset the extra procs
 Merge pull request #817 from AlexanderUlanH/tempgun Makes the temperature projectile get its temperature from the gun, using a proc used to give the bullet properties based on the properties of the gun, which can be used with other projectiles for different guns.

 Added some restrained() checks for mechas at entering on them.
 A world << "" passed, deleting it. Sorry.
 Removed a bunch of copy pasted code regarding moving pulled atmos by clicking on turfs or conveyors. Now this is handled by a mob proc, Move_Pulled() Now all turfs work with this feature. (shuttle shitty turfs didn't because they were not part of /floor) Added a check on Move_Pulled() to see if the pulled atom is on a turf. This will stop the sleeper exploit and others.
 new_player href sanitization Prevents players from modifying another player's preferences and character setup.

 Welding gas mask Adds a new item to RnD which is a gasmask with integrated welding visor. Requires low level (2) of Engineering and Materials, 4000 metal, 2000 glass (1000 more of each compared to a standard welding helmet), fits in the mask slot. The idea behind this is that it will give engineers the functionality of Rig Helmets (head lamp and welding visor, and free eye slot for mesons) when combined with a hard hat. Included some placeholder sprites: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/95696802/Commits/weldinggasmask.png

 Securer secure crates Increased the health of secure crates by a factor of ten. Originally I was going to null out the projectile proc and add an emp_act instead, but one already exists. The increased health of the secure crate will allow them to still be broken open from gun fire, but will make it inconvenient enough to dissuade cargo arming up every round, hopefully... (it will take 17 buckshot or 50 lasers to break open a crate)

 Adds WJohnston's rainbow esword and dual-esword sprites. Also corrected a few bugs involving esword sprites, mainly involving the player sprite not updating when they construct dual-eswords. It turns out that player-sprite updating is magnets, so the eventual solution was for the player to drop both swords before they're deleted. Since dual-eswords were already created on the ground, this changes very little. A dual-esword inherits the emagged state of the esword being attack_by'd.
 Fixed Changeling Absorb not requiring chokegrabs It now has a check that checks what it's meant to check.

His locker is swapped position with his file cabinet (this does make the HoP office slightly more secure as break ins will need to unwrench the drawers to move them) The airlocks into the main area are changed to bridge access so all heads of staff can access the HoP's office again.

 *Adds two syndicate bombs and a syndicate minibomb to the nuke ops shuttle, at the cost of the three tank transfer bombs *fixes a runtime with syndicate bombs related to wires.dm looking for people who had been reduced to a fine red mist

 New emag icon by Fireshade. It just adds the same shading as the other cards, to add consistency.
 Renamed some access labels to help make the ID Computer window smaller.
 Emagging the comms console gives you full functionality *Does not bypass the Bridge access requirement to use the console. It only upgrades authentication level from 1 to 2. This is done so that traitors won't need Captain access if they want to contact The Syndicate.
 Adds the Syndicate Minibomb and Syndicate Bomb to traitor PDAs The minibomb is based on grenade code with a blast radius of 1,2,4 and is found in syndieminibomb.dm. This is the same power as the default tank transfer bombs spawned on the syndicate shuttle. It features new sprites by teh_wolf and existing inhands (the default grenade) and is a tiny item. As a result of introducing an explosive grenade, grenade priming are now logged. Its crystal cost has tentatively been set at 3. --- The Syndicate Bomb is all new code contained in explosives.dm with additional wires code at syndicatebomb.dm. It does not make use of any tank transfer valve or grenade code. The bomb has a blast radius of 2,5,11. This is the same power as the tank transfer bombs in the syndicate shuttle if they are boosted with oxygen. It features new sprites by teh_wolf and existing inhands (currently using “electronic”) and is a bulky item. The bomb is set by touching it in your hand or touching it on the ground if it has been wrenched down, allowing first to set a timer (min 10 seconds) and then giving an option to start the countdown. When the bomb is activated it states so to everyone within sight of it, giving a time to detonation in the process. The bomb can optionally be wrenched to solid ground to foil would be spacers. When the bomb is set to countdown the bolts lock in, and cannot be removed by wrench alone. The bomb includes a robust wires system for pulse pounding defusal attempts. Once a bomb starts ticking using the wires is the only way to stop it (it is not immune to del of course, but is unacidable). The wires are as follows: *Boom: Will detonate the bomb if cut/pulsed while the bomb is live, but will defuse the bomb on cut when it's not timing. Mending this wire is the only way to make a defused bomb potent again. *Unbolt: If the bomb has been locked to the floor cutting this will free it. Pulsing will hint at its function *Delay: Adds time (+10) to the timer when pulsed (it does not matter if the bomb is live or not). No function on cut. *Proceed: Lowers the time when pulsed. If the timer is above 60 it will set it to 60, if it’s between 60 and 21 it will reduce the timer by 10, if it’s between 20 and 11 it will set the timer to 10. This will detonate the bomb when cut if it's timing. Note that this makes randomly cutting more dangerous than pulsing as there’s twice the number of wires that will explode. *Activate: This will activate the timer if pulsed when the bomb is not timing, or will stop and defuse the bomb if it's cut while it IS timing. Pulsing it on an active bomb will hint at its function and add a little time (+5). All syndicate bomb primings are logged. Its crystal cost has tentatively been set at 5. --- Misc The “screwed” traitor uplink kit has had its tank transfer bombs replaced with one of each of these two bombs.
 Changed food crate to include all of chef's basic ingredients. Changed supply shuttle console to no longer require a reason while ordering. The requests console is unchanged and must have something in the reason field.

 Final? values for camerabug expansion item types There wasn't much feedback, so I just threw together something acceptable, not being able to think of anything particularly clever. - Universal bug: atmos analyzer or subspace analyzer - Sabotage bug: Igniter, infrared tripwire thing, or subspace amplifier - Network bug: Radio, signaler, or subspace transmitter - Advanced bug: Detective scanner, pAI card, or scanning module stock part

 - If they are turned on, radios inform the person they are on if they overload due to an EMP.
 The victim will now get a message if the user empties their pockets and gets interrupted. (Victim moving, user being stunned, etc..)
 * Added a message to the user.
 Emptying someone's pockets won't display a message anymore. This allows people to pickpocket if their victim stands still long enough.
 * Fixes damage converter converting when there is only toxin damage in the mob. * Increased the damage probability to be more effective.
 Separates the continuous round config options to be round-specific. For example, one can config wizard rounds don't have to end upon the wizard's death, while Rev rounds will still end upon one side's defeat.
 Food update - -Removes all the dumb weapon/syntiflesh recipes. Remove syntikebab. Cleans up commented-out stuff that'll never be readded. -Deletes jar.dm, which I tried to delete months ago but somehow messed up. -'Imitation' carp meat can now be made with 5 units of carpotoxin and some tofu. -Some recipes changed slightly. -Adds berry muffins and booberry muffins. Cleaned up the carton-based sprites in drinks.dmi to look better. New sprites for muffins, donut boxes, brain burgers, super big bite burgers, enchiladas, monkey delight, baguettes, fried eggs, wing fang chu, clown's tears, and mystery soup. I also completely reorganized the food.dmi (and made my bed and mopped the floors)
 Reduced burn out chance to 4% EMPs have a chance of overloading flashbulbs.
 Makes radios more vulnerable to EMP: Department channels that are turned off now cannot be broadcasted into. EMPs will now shift the frequency of a radio a bit. This is supposed to make EMP a viable option for a traitors or nuke agents that are looking to take someone out without the entire station knowing about it.

 Makes the admin "Show Crew Manifest" verb inside the secrets window actually show the Crew Manifest, instead of the old dumb way of just looking at whatever ID human players are holding.
 comments for new defines
 Removed accidentally included mask test item
 Changes the check for blindfolds healing eye damage and making the mob blind to work off tintcheck()
 Combines the prototypes back into one finished camera bug. Adds an associative list sorter to the helper procs. This will sort a list while maintaining the key=value structure. The tracking functions of the camera bug will now auto-refresh if you keep the window open. The functionality was there but broken previously. This allows you to creepily stalk someone or observe a sensitive area. The camera bug is now extensible. If you add an extension of certain types, the bug will have additional functionality. A screwdriver will remove the existing extension. Additionally, an admin/testing version of the camera bug can be created with the research admin spawnable item. This is not the final version of this code; sane item types for the extensions must be chosen. I do not have any that are feasible right now.
 Fixes Pod Person Cloning *You can create clones from replica pods now, even if they aren't in their body at time of harvest *This fixes find_dead_player in cloning.dm, which was excluding ghosts because it demanding a brain *Thanks to Aranclanos who basically figured everything out
 Improved eyecheck() Changes flash/welder protection eyecheck() proc from several hard coded item checks to a /var check for eye covering items, reducing the number of IF statements and allowing greater flexibility as child items can have a different protection level to their parent. Created a new proc tintcheck() -Items have a separate tint var to allow for items to protect but not impair, such as space helmets. -tintcheck() adds these up for eye covering locations -life.dm uses this new proc when checking to apply the welder overlay instead of hardcoded if statements

 *You now talk to the voices in your head with :p for personality. *Voices now show up in the player panel. (Note that if you make the voice into a corgi with adminmagic the poor guy will have a corgi stuck inside of him) *Voices now again count as alive. Changed that for some reason, they should of course not hear deadchat.
 Changeling personal hivemind *Creates new living mobtype: voices who are created inside of other living mobs. They communicate only with other voices in the same mob and the mob itself. *Uses the new mobtype for changelings. Lings now have the option to absorb the "memories" of a target. The memories can ghost on their own accord or be forced out by a changeling to prevent spam or verbal abuse. After ghosting the former voice can re-enter the original body (now probably a husk). *Adds an argument to the ghostize verb to have the ghost refer to a new mind. This was used to have voices be able to enter their own body. - Adds the option for a living mob with voices to talk to them using ":v". (This isn't in the current patch for some reason)] *changeling powers can now have multiple verbs tied to them

 Improved a few lines based on Pete and Aranclanos's feedback. Also removed the "capitalize" call, which wasn't working, instead breaking the string up into two parts. BYOND macros are weird, but it works great.
 Fixed a lot of text, mostly in simple_animal. The word "the" was being duplicated in a lot of cases when referring to objects or mobs. Basically, byond handles "the" for us. Poly was particularly guilty of this, but really it was all simple_mobs. Also fixed issue 566, where it was possible to weaken corpses. Dead humans, humanoid aliens, and larvae should no longer be weakenable once they're dead. Also also, changed the default name for human mobs from unknown to Unknown. This is makes them consistent with humans whose identity is destroyed by acid or face damage. They'll no longer show up as "The unknown" in messages, since Byond recognizes Unknown as a proper noun due to capitalization. Finally, gave Runtime a DNA joke as a description. Not sure why she didn't have a description.

 A-star fixes Will obey the maxnodes parameter if it's provided (although perhaps not in the way that it was originally meant?) The only one that uses it is disease, and it wasn't an issue there, but at least in future it won't be a problem. Also slightly increased the maximum loop count from 1500 to 1800, on the off-chance that the previous value was pessimistically low. In the initial station this doesn't go past 1000, but if bots understand doors their paths might get squiggly.

Also changed the examine text from 'water' to 'liquid' as it was misleading. It can actually be filled with any reagent, even welder fuel...or acid... or blood... or dr.gibb...space lube... you get the picture.

 Fixes #559 - Changelings are no longer so obviously faking when they are faking death.
 Sandbox improvements Reduced the overwhelming size of items list by removing huge categories into their own separate lists; this affects /obj/item/clothing and /obj/item/weapon/reagent_containers. Removes a bunch of unsanitary items from the spawn list. Makes RCD quick spawn button check for spawn disabled flag since it can destroy walls and floors with impunity. Adds cleanbot to quick spawn list. Removes the check for the spawn flag from the dialog construction, because it is cached; if the admin turns it on during the round, people who already have a sandbox panel will be unable to use it. Adds a disclaimer to the sandbox panel vis a vis admin disabling.
 Instead of showing a negative time, the supply status displays will inform you that the shuttle is late.

 update_icons.dm changes for humans. This ties in with the dna changes and the changes to skin_tone and hair colours >update_mutantrace() is no more, it is now part of update_body() >Moved a lot of stuff into update_base_icon_state(), this will allow making mutantraces modular. Almost all icon operations are now removed from human overlays (obviously some are still required for recolouring hair and eyes). Any remaining dynamically generated overlay icons are applied individually. This will allow byond to cache them better. This will also eliminate the bug where humans are initially invisible/unclickable when you first encounter them (due to network latency where the icons are being downloaded). >UpdateDamageIcons() renamed to update_damage_overlays(), so it has the same sort of name as the other procs >update_icons=true or false arguments removed from human overaly-update procs, no longer required. (i.e. the update_body() update_inv_whatever etc procs do not call update_icons() - see documentation for details) >mutantrace icon_states moved into human.dmi >skeletons are now a mutantrace, not a mutation. >update_icons system should now be even more efficient (thanks partly to aranclanos) >documentation rewritten >copypasted code moved into helper procs - super tidy code :3 Other: >Removed compile error where the core code was reliant on compiling away mission code. >:[ >s_tone renamed to skin_tone Modified code/modules/mob/living/carbon/human/update_icons.dm Modified code/__DEFINES.dm Modified code/datums/datumvars.dm Modified code/datums/limbs.dm Modified code/game/dna.dm Modified code/game/gamemodes/changeling/changeling_powers.dm Modified code/game/gamemodes/cult/cult_items.dm Modified code/game/gamemodes/cult/runes.dm Modified code/game/machinery/doors/airlock.dm Modified code/game/machinery/portable_turret.dm Modified code/game/machinery/teleporter.dm Modified code/game/mecha/combat/combat.dm Modified code/game/objects/items.dm Modified code/game/objects/items/stacks/medical.dm Modified code/game/objects/items/stacks/sheets/glass.dm Modified code/game/objects/items/weapons/storage/bible.dm Modified code/modules/assembly/mousetrap.dm Modified code/modules/hydroponics/hydroitemcode.dm Modified code/modules/mob/living/carbon/carbon.dm Modified code/modules/mob/living/carbon/human/death.dm Modified code/modules/mob/living/carbon/human/human.dm Modified code/modules/mob/living/carbon/human/human_damage.dm Modified code/modules/mob/living/carbon/human/human_defines.dm Modified code/modules/mob/living/living.dm Modified code/modules/mob/living/simple_animal/friendly/slime.dm Modified code/modules/mob/mob_grab.dm Modified code/modules/power/lighting.dm Modified code/modules/reagents/Chemistry-Reagents.dm Modified code/unused/_debug.dm Modified icons/effects/genetics.dmi Modified icons/mob/human.dmi Modified maps/RandomZLevels/wildwest.dm Modified tgstation.dme Signed-off-by: carnie <elly1989@rocketmail.com>

 Makes the scrubber spawn "on", with a higher pressure intake, in case it is needed. Makes the spawned ID display the appropriate name and rank.
 Update to Sandbox Panel The panel itself has been updated with subcategories and additional options. The "air regulator" option was removed because what even does that mean. The Suit Up option has been fixed, and should work properly now. Additional items include an all-access ID, RCD, flashlight, light replacer, plasteel, cable, floorbot, medbot, gas mask, and emergency air tank. The hrefs var was moved out of global scope because that's a terrible place for something so generically named. The Spawn Item and Spawn Canister dialogs now use a browser window instead of a pick list. This window is cached per user. Sandbox's Spawn Airlock option gets a new interface. It allows you to pick the accesses of the new airlock, as well as its paintjob, name, glass inserts where appropriate, and an option to make the access list "require one" instead of "require all." It adds an airlock frame which can be repositioned; attack-hand-ing the airlock frame (if it has the airlock builder datum attached) will now open the window. An administrative option has been added to the sandbox panel, which is configurable through game_options.txt. Because the item spawning uses a persistent browser window, it is susceptible to spamming. The added option forces the window closed after each item is spawned. This only affects the item and canister selection windows, and not the whole sandbox panel.

 Updated changelog
 Increased toolbox force to 12
 Removed extinguisher change
 Penalty for claiming that there's an error when there actually isn't. CentComm doesn't appreciate being falsely accused of incompetency. (Penalty is the cost of the package minus the crate cost, just like the refund). Supply points can go negative, which works as expected.
 Added a box of prisoner ID cards to the perma wing Aside from further dehumanizing criminal scum this also serves as a way of correcting the annoying behavior of suit sensors and crew monitoring computers, and chemical implants: if someone isn't wearing an ID card (which prisoners will likely have taken from them) they show up as an Unknown. Also included a sec hud icon for the prisoner 'job'
 Attached changelog
 Raised toolbox force to 10 Reduced extinguisher force to 5
 Increased sacid meltprob from 5 to 10
 mice become items when they die. mousetraps now make the SNAP sound based on their location rather then the targets.
 Changed moneyplants to use the plant's potency instead of a random value when generating spacecash.

 Mech fabricator fix Mech fabs were looking in their lighting sub-area to connect to equipment in their logical area; if the mech fab and the R&D computer were at different lighting levels, they would cease to be in the same area, making them fail to connect. This adds a global helper proc to return the contents of a logical area rather than the lighting sub-area. Makes failing to connect to an R&D computer a recoverable error.

 Changed all crit checks from static zeros to config.health_threshold_crit
 Updated object melt probability I overlooked.
 Acid Damage Fix Redid a portion of how acid damage is applied. People were not being disfigured when sprayed, and contact with acid for some reason had a 15% chance to do ridiculous damage (~30 per spray puff), otherwise it did very little (~6). It should be more consistent now around the ~12 range per spray puff. Glasses melt too, now.
 Fixes the bug where clown stamps were usable by anyone, they just didn't affect the sprite. Also made the stamp check for clumsiness instead of mind.assigned_role.
 Removing the crate-cost from the refund value now uses points_per_crate instead of being hardcoded to 5.
 removed changelog.html Well I thought it was game changing :(
 fixed the changelog... could've sworn I pressed reload
 Changed the health check for crit in life.dm for humans, monkeys, and aliens from < 0 to <= 0. Fixes that weird issue where people can take 5 laser hits to the face and still run around at 0 health until someone sneezes on them or they stub their toe.

 typo fix for aran
 Part one is here: #450 This pull request adds the box of medals to the map (Captain's Office), as well as updating the changelog.html Also includes minor string and sprite fixes.
 Adds the RD's reactive armor to possible steal objectives. Reactive armor now spawns in the RD's locker. Replaced some tables with racks in the RD's office.
 Fixes for admin-spawned dnainjectors: repeat_string has been simplified (it wasn't making NULLED_SE and NULLED_UI to the correct size). Fix for Overpowered mutations (HULK and TELE) not manifesting. A typo was the cause. Admin-spawnable injectors always succeed. This code already existed (I believe this is how they used to function), but it did not work as the argument was not passed correctly. This also removed snowflake code for the darkbundle telemut injector. Thanks to Giacom, wouldn't have found these without him.
 SPRITE UPDATE & FIXES -Fixes a bug with the crew monitoring computer vanishing entirely when broken. -Fixes a bug with baton rechargers not displaying properly when the baton is fully charged. -Adds a define for a decorative item for the RD's office. :) -New sprites for mining lanterns, telescreens (with directionals), directionals for noticeboards, and a service bell.

 Changed stand_icon to face_standing so update_body won't have to be used to clear it. Used update_hair(0) instead of update_hair()
 Updated all maps with path changes.
 Removed the process() from firedoors, reducing the amount of machines of the gameticker on 222. Added the proc latetoggle() for firedoors, it will be called each time that a firedoor closes, open or recovers power. This proc will check if the var "nextstate" is active, to open or close the firedoor.
 Revert "- Removes mimes' ability to speak. Clowns cannot break their clumsy nature, so mimes should not be able to break their silence." This reverts commit 7417d10c99199e4ad8a2d0a7dba63d56a3d1acb2.
 Same crap, for the fourth time. Created a new subtype from radios, /obj/item/device/radio/bounced They have no difference except from spawning with their speakers off. The only reason is to reduce in a 30% the amount of loops in the general channel chat lag.
 Removed the commented out code from the auto update options of exosuit fabricators. For this reason, the exosuit fabricators will be removed from the process() list at roundstart.
 Removed the auto-update from exosuit fabricates. They were huge lag generators, loops inside of other loops each process() tick. This will help to reduce lag.
 Re-enabled bag item count thing
 Cable coils now update mob inhands correctly when used up. Changed cable coil items to use the existing update_icon() proc, instead of their own updateicon().
 Fixed the robot sight modules, eg mesons not clearing on death.
 Fixed the pinpointer ignoring z-level changes and directing the user to a nonsense location if the disk is on a different z-level
 A fix for a runtime that would occur if you tried to re-brain a monkey.
 Placing a brain back into a human calls update_hair(). They will look bald.
 Changed machine frame to automatically generated required component description and to update the amounts as components are added.
 Adds luminosity back to weed nodes.
 Moves /obj/effect/alien to /obj/structure/alien. Does not update the map. Moves /obj/effect/alien/acid to /obj/effect/acid. Adds a new sprite for acid. Standardises and updates text styling in code/game/objects/effects/aliens.dm.
 Moves /obj/effect/decal/mecha_wreckage to /obj/structure/mecha_wreckage. Does not update the map. Standardises and updates text styling in mecha_wreckage.dm.

 Resolves #283 DNA modification uses normally distributed random numbers. Radiation strength dictates the standard deviation of the change in the hex character which is hit (higher output means greater chance for a large change) . Similarly, radiation duration dictates how likely we are to hit the hex-character we clicked on (longer duration means more likely to hit). Irradiation is strength*duration. All balancing is done via multiplier defines so you can rebalance it easily. DNA blocks and structuring all use defines. Making modification/expansion easier. I'll likely expand this into a datum-based system to allow more interesting features, reduce code further and allow admins to interact with the way dna strings behave. DNA strings can be spliced together using merge_text(). e.g. string 1: "Hello World" string 2: "Seeya______" result: "Seeya World" This isn't used except for admin-spawnable SE injectors at the moment. r_hair, g_hair, b_hair, r_facial, g_facial, b_facial, r_eyes, g_eyes, b_eyes were removed and made into 3 short hex-colors. Skin tones now support colours other than shades of brown. I've had to restrict it heavily until other stuff is done. Skin tones include Albino Caucasian, Oriental, Mediterranean, etc. Data disks and DNA injectors were reworked to use associative lists so transferring data is just a matter of doing list.Copy() var/dna is now defined at /mob/living/carbon level. Only monkeys and humans may have dna currently. Support is there for all carbon-based lifeforms to have dna. DNA modifier console has almost all controls on one screen. UIs and UEs can be injected separately (appearance and name, respectively) dna helper procs like ready_dna() and such were changed to make them more versatile. There is now a hardset_dna() proc as an alternative to ready_dna which can initialize dna with properties passed into it or update an existing dna string (useful for cloning and antag spawning) Every block of SEs are in randomised positions. Disabled automatic logging of world.log, as it produced undesirable behaviour. Mr Muggles and God Emperor of Mankind disks removed. Floor() removed. (it was completely uneccesary, that is what round() is). Fixed spelling mistakes in modularchangling.dm (thanks tenebrosity) Tanning removed from beaches (again) Experimental: monkeys and humans do not have dna until first attempt to read dna (using check_dna_integrity(mob)) This is mainly due to the way everything is hardcoded into New().

 Modification to Pete's commit. var/list/type/subtype/L -> var/list/L
 Removes equip_e - Fixes #423 This updates everything that used equip_e, particularly the strip panel, but also DNA injectors and CPR. Removed unused mob vars: var/obj/effect/organstructure/organStructure var/other var/proc_holder_list[] Removed unused alien suit and head slots. Removed var/obj/item/weapon/card/id/wear_id from monkeys, and updated ed209s to not use : Renamed HUMAN_STRIP_DELAY to STRIP_DELAY. Muddled Topics() around so that mobs are now a bit more OO. Also updated quite a few misc inventory procs to various degrees. Updated monkey and aliens huds a little bit. Random movement when confused now happens half the time. Fixed monkey breathmask onmobs. Added a .unconscious text style, for that nice bold blue text you get when you're unconscious. Only CPR uses it at the moment. This has been tested fairly extensively, and everything seems to work fine. -Merged commits ~carnie Signed-off-by: carnie <elly1989@rocketmail.com>

 The automatic shuttle call will now be triggered if there are no communications console on the station z level or an active AI. The shuttle will not have the standard 10 minutes to arrive, instead, it will take 25 minutes, so they have 20 minutes to recall. They will use the new proc autoshuttlecall() in the emergency_shuttle controller. Instead of taking a loop on world, there's a new list, shuttle_caller_list, it includes all communication consoles and AIs.

 Insulation Change: Bomb Suit armor Bombs suits are pretty useless atm so I made them into ghetto riot gear; my line of thinking being that its a big heavy suit with lots of padding, its going to be half-decent against people trying to beat you. Won't really have much impact on the game, theres only three on the map and one of them is in the armory
 Gives fire suits a bit of extra cold protection over normal armor. I set it to 60, so you can't use fire suits like the ghetto space suits of old (which would be impossible to emulate now, back then coldness did only negligible damage) but it is enough for atmostechs to clean up a medbay cryo leak, and they will protect you long enough for the ballsy atmos tech to plug a hullbreach, or gives an unlucky engineer about a minute thirty to wire a solar array.

Just print out the beanbag shells at the autolathe. -The previously-overpacked Riot gear crate comes with 1 less set of equipment, but with more handcuffs. Made cheaper to compensate.

 Merge pull request #329 from Carn/Issue304 Resolves Issue #304
 >datum/event and datum/event_control were renamed to datum/round_event and datum/round_event_control. This is because datum/event was already used by a different/more-general event queue system (used primarily on mechas) Removed overriding of event values via feeding in an associative list into datum/round_event/New(). Instead you can do basic initializations (i.e. feed it constants) by doing new /datum/round_event{variablename=5;}(). This method is handled well by the compiler (it's the same method the maps use), so it will detect unrecognized variablenames etc. More complex initializations for post setup() stuff can be done by accessing variables directly Event.variablename = whatever; round_events now have a processing variable, which effectively pauses them.

 Added two if(stat == CONSCIOUS) checks and a comment to human_defense.dm. Stops dead/unconscious people giving 'x was knocked unconscious' style messages.
 Removed a comment I should have removed before the previous commit.
 - Added an extra variable to determine the behavior of bans when they are applied. The variable is kickbannedckey. It is used to determine whether the bans, which are handled by db_ban kick the mob or not, if he is connected, that is. Some ban types, such as permaban and tempban, do not use this, as it is handled by legacy ban code.
 Admin bans - Adds two new types of bans: admin tempbans and admin permabans. These ban types are in reaction to the rising number of banworthy admin issues. The original intent was to make admins unbannable ingame, so players could not spoof admin computer ids to get admins banned, with the assumption that admin issues will be rare and a big deal when they happen. They have however started becoming ever more common, so some tools are required to allow for admin self-policing. - Each admin can have a maximum of one active admin ban (temporary or permanent) logged to their name. This is to prevent rogue admins from just banning everyone who could ban them. These bans are also not intended to be 'permanent-permanent'. They are intended to serve as a temporary fix, to get rid of rogue admins until the server host or another admin with rdp access (or +PERMISSIONS if you use DB_Admin) can deal with the rogue admin's removal. Once that is done, a normal permaban or tempban can be applied, and the admin permaban/tempban removed, restoring the banning admin's 1 allowed admin ban. - Admin bans are considered a big deal, so they also send a message to irc, when they are applied. - NOTE: Admin bans only check the connecting person's ckey. The risk of computer id spoofing still exists, so it's better not to have them check ips and computer ids. The admin abilities are given based on ckey anyway, so a ckey ban should be enough in most cases. Other changes to bans - Added a few variables to the funciton that adds a ban: maxadminbanchec (which is for admin bans and checks how many bans the admin can still apply); announceinirc and blockselfban (which prevents admins from applying the ban type on themselves. Currently applied for permaban, tempban, admin permaban, admin tempban) - Changed the appearance ban database constant from APPEARANCE_BAN to APPEARANCE_PERMABAN, to make it more compatible with the ban log at http://www.ss13.eu/tgdb/banoverview.php - Added a missing sanity check to topic.dm for appearance bans - Renamed appearance bans to identity bans in admin panels (as per Pete's request)

 Fixes Issue #197 - "Camera Range Display" verb now uses obj/machinery/camera/proc/can_see() to calculate which turfs are visible by cameras. Each turf in camera-range is marked with a maptext number indicating how many cameras can see that turf. IMPORTANT: Changed the default fonts of the skinfile. This works around an issue with byond, where certain font-faces can cause HUGE increases in memory usage client-side, giving the illusion of lag, or severe crashes. Before changing the font-face to 'Arial': using the camera range display verb would cause dream-seeker's memory usage to climb from 146,000 K to 800,000 K (and greater, but that is the limit of my laptop's pagefile, hence crashing my entire system) After changing the font-face to 'Arial': using the same verb (with same code) resulted in negligible memory usage increase in dreamseeker, and works absolutely fine. Status displays and such were not affected by this bug as they use a different font to the default set in the skinfile. It did however affect stuff such as mining satchels, and may explain why some users found the game extremely 'laggy' or crashy

 Fixes circuit printers not accepting acid. Their afterattack() was being ignored.

 Uplink Update: * Added datums for uplink items. This allows you to easily add items to the uplink in a maintainable manner. * This fixes the href exploit which allowed traitors to spawn any item they wish. * Made the uplink interface still show unbuyable items, but grayed out. * After unlocking your PDA, it will return to the main menu; this will help stop metagamers. * Your password will be trimmed, meaning that entering "213 Alpha " will be correct and won't set it as your ringtone. * Replaced all the old uplink code, which is useless now. * Changed all the feedback procs to instead use the uplink datum's name. This is important if you are keeping track of stats. * Moved the bundle uplink item to the "Badass" category.
 * Default time should now use the dd/mm/yyyy format.

 Mobs each now have a unique tag which are not after they are deleted (unlike byond's \ref[] macro) Since tag replaces the output of the \ref[] macro, this means that menus which use hrefs with \ref[mob] will no longer be able to accidentally link to the wrong mob. The tags are of the form "mob_475" etc Admin_pms now use ckey instead of client-reference. This means that PMs will no longer accidentally get sent to the wrong people. There is no risk of players using hrefs to send adminhelps to known admin ckeys to see if they are online (as I'd already changed the PM system to not tell non-admin users whom received their message). key_name() now accepts text input (key or ckey) - it is slightly more efficient to feed it a client or mob however! This functionality is provided to allow certain admintools to become more robust when we want to talk about e.g. a griefer whom has just DCed whom no-longer has a corpse (no client/mob...just a ckey reference). key_name() now reports DCed players properly.

I'm leaving it for now, as the game seems to have gotten on well enough so far, and it'll probably just increase processing for no gain if I fix it.

 Refactored underwear to use datum/sprite_accessory/underwear similar to hair and facial_hair. People may select any underwear (regardless of gender) at a dresser, but not in preferences. random_underwear(gender) will return a random pair of underwear suitable for your gender. Removed an unused variable in sprite_accessory The new_player preferences screen now randomizes character slots for which there is no data (so no more bald, fat, white guys in diapers greeting new players) datum/preferences character settings are randomised at New(). replaced /datum/preferences/proc/randomize_appearance_for(human/H) with /datum/preferences/proc/random_character(), it does the same stuff without the copying to a mob. Basically, now when you want to make a random character you just do var/datum/preferences/A = new(); A.copy_to(human_mob), randomisation of appearance and name will already be done. Easy. Reworked the savefile updating/versioning code to make it easier to work with. I've used it to update underwear preferences to the new system as an example.

 Merge pull request #64 from Metacide/master Updated MetaStation v24A.dmm to MetaStation v24B.dmm
 Improvements to debug verbs del-all and spawn. Long paths are shortened, del-all got filter like spawn had. Long lists of paths are cached.
 Updated MetaStation v24A.dmm to MetaStation v24B.dmm -Fixed disposals mass driver path being blocked by grilles in space -Also added a glass door and conveyor to the disposals MULEBOT destination, meaning the whole maint area won't lose pressure if the blast door is left open.

 -Adds a confirmation message to the Empty Spray Bottle verb. -Reorganizes all the copy-pasted reagents in Chemistry-Reagents.dm. Cuts out about a THOUSAND lines. -Sleep toxin is made more subtle. No blurry screen, but you might yawn some. Chloral no longer has an instant KO effect, but your vision will become blurry and you'll be unable to run once injected. It is metabolized faster as well.
 Changed the airlock_painter stuff back to how Ricotez had them coded. Instead of clicking on the painter and setting the airlock type that way, you do it when you click on the door with the painter. Cheridan fixed the inhand sprites being off, thanks Cheridan!
 Same change here, but with monkeys.
 Fixed items not appearing on the HUD if they are given to a mob by another player with the strip panel. This should also swap under the carpet (kinda ugh because the problem is still there and it might affect some other things) the problems with the roundstart problems with player's icons on high populated servers. This should be the first step to reduce the amount of calls on the different icon update procs, but for the moment I'm focusing on more CPU expensive procs.

 Committing Elo001's job management stuff. I made some very minor modifications (mainly tidied up the code a little bit so it's easier to read/modify). I have made it so opened_positions can be negative. This means that reopening original positions, which were just closed, no longer requires an annoying cooldown period. Removed the "AI" "Cyborg" "Assistant" checks since they were already handled within the blacklist. The can_close_job and can_open_job procs now return codes for different reasons for failure (this removed a little bit of code duplication) Nice work for a first commit, Elo :3
 DNA Machine tweaks to fix runtimes for when the machine disappears Really a fix on the commit from earlier, which I'm aware didn't work. I tested this extensively, works just fine.
 Expanded what can light things. Cigars and pipes can now be lit by standard sources. Standard sources are: Lighter, Zippo, Igniter, weldingtool, energy sword, and candles.
 Made the effects of EMP pulses get garbage collected. Less lag on the singularity (around 20 effect del per 5~10 seconds)

 * Committing in NTSL now takes time. It can take up to a maximum of 2.5 minutes and a minimum of 10 seconds. * The server will not warn admins when empty code is being compiled, but it will still log everywhere else. * Empty code will have no compile time. * Removed NTSL broadcasting the names in italics if the name is unknown. This was causing issues and it was a very minor feature. * Placed some duplicated code into a proc, for the IDE verbs.

 Updates HUD stuff! The main goal was to remove all the pointless shit in the UI style dmis, but this commit actually goes a bit deeper than that. Formally renames the "hurt" intent to "harm", in line with everything else in the world. Removes the old screen1_... .dmis. They've been replaced with screen_... .dmis. They function much the same. screen_gen.dmi is used for things which apply to multiple UI styles, such as storage slot sprites, or the intent selector. (These can still be overridden in HUD code, though.) Item action buttons have been changed to use a template from the UI style, and the icon_state of the item. var/icon_action_button has been removed- varvar/action_button_name must be used instead to add action buttons for items. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@5826 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Shuffled all the #defines in global.dm and setup.dm They have been separated into low-level stuff that you wouldn't really want to ever edit (like the definition of PI) which are in __DEFINES.dm The others, which hosts could possibly want to modify for their server, are located in _compile_options.dm I've tried to group it together in some sort of logical way so it's easier to find what you need. Feel free to move whatever. Main reason for the change is so we can add some more compile options into the game to make it more configurable. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@5825 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 - Cleaned up the hostile mobs. It will also factor the mech's location, making sure it isn't too far away before doing a line of sight calculation.

 Replaced get_apprentice_candidates() with get_candidates(BE_WIZARD) /proc/testing("message") will now only print message to world.log if #define TESTING is uncommented. This will allow coders to make in-depth debug messages for confusing bits of code. Said debug messages would not be visible on th elive server, but coders can enable them by compiling with #define TESTING uncommented. This should make debugging ikky horrible code easier (assuming people bother to use testing()) Temporarily removed the weightless (aka gravity failure) event, due to people hating it. ;( Replaced references to KILL with PROCESS_KILL (I didn't realise I had already defined something like that). Setup.dm and global.dm are rather cluttered. I will be cleaning them up and will remove a few unused defines like #define KILL in my next commit. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@5822 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Changes on how some simple hostile mobs search for targets, they now make a list of mobs at sight with the heareable() proc and add the mechs of a new global list instead of checking all the atoms in a radius of 21x21. The new global list is called mechas_list, it contains all the mechs (sadly the 8 mechs of centcomm are added to this list, just to avoid problems with other servers with different maps) Clowns, goats and spiders still use the old way to track targets (the view() proc). The goal of this commit is to reduce lag, it will be really noticeable on the carp migration event, they should be 70% less laggy. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@5820 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

MouseDown() is now completely unused. From the Byond ref: "Don't define this unless you need it, because it generates extra communication that is otherwise avoided." Fixes issue 1378. Carbon jetpacks are used as internals Back tanks are now checked last when searching for internals. Moved var/foldable from /obj/item/weapon/storage to ..storage/box.

 Airlock settings for the RCD. Committing for Ricotez: http://forums.nanotrasen.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=12054 This adds a verb to the RCD which allows the player to select which type of airlock it spits out. I've set the hand-held RCD is set to create any colour airlock while the borg's RCD can only spawn the default glass and solid airlock. The reason for this is that the borg has no way to change the ID requirements of the door and the borg's RCD is already vastly superior to the handheld version because of how it draws power. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@5812 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Changes for all the different update icons procs of humans and monkeys, they now update their own sprite and hud icon (if it's a proc of a slot item) without having to call for update_icons(). A lot of different calls for update_inv_[slot] now won't call for update_icons.dm(). Such as dropping, throwing, picking up objects, moving objects around your gear, using your active hand, firing guns, stripping, etc. All the different calls for UpdateDamageIcon() now they won't call for update_icons() The different sprites of humans/monkeys will now have their own layer, humans starting with MUTANTRACE_LAYER in layer -1 to R_HAND_LAYER in layer -20, so the sprites don't get messy overlapping eachother if update_icons() is not called. To help this change, all layers numbers were changed, R_HAND_LAYER used to be 1, now it's 20. (This can be changed back if it ends up being confusing or ugly to read) TL;RL I removed 90% of the calls for update_icons() modifying the different update procs of update_icons.dm of monkeys/humans. The goal is to reduce lag. JUST IN CASE, lying down will call for update_icons(), so players have an easy way to update their icons if something goes horribly wrong. Which won't. I hope. Fixes issue 842. Handcuffs sprites appearing on the player's UI if this one was handcuffed. Because I liked this we'll call it feature and add some awesome sprites made by Cheridan, you'll now have a new sprite on your UI telling you "you're handcuffed buddy!".

 Made cult blades/double barrel shotguns fit on exosuit slots again. Wizard staffs, SAW, combat shotgun still don't Added the Mjollnir and Singularity Hammer. Just silly melee weapons I coded/sprited for fun. Both are using the Mjollnir's sprites currently though I didn't have it in me to make a billion more inhands for the Singularity Hammer. Mjollnir shocks the target and hurls them away/spews lightning around. Singularity Hammer pulls everything nearby in towards the target. Don't really have plans to balance them or make them obtainable in game but I thought as long as I'd coded them some admin or another may enjoy trading them to antags/giving them to the chaplain etc. Lowered fireballs cooldown and decreased its explosion size (so wizards can use it without killing themselves by causing hull breaches) git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@5805 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 A little bit of admin button cleanup from the Secrets Panel. Renamed "Toggle station artificial gravity" to "Trigger a gravity-failure event" to better describe what the button does.

 Gave telecomms access to basic engineers and removed it from the RD. Reasoning is as follows: A) The engineers already have space suits to work on the airless tcomms equipment B) Station system maintenance should be engineering's thing C) The RD already has robotics, genetics, xenobio, RnD, and toxins. Engineers set up the engine in ten minutes and are left to fuck around until something is blown up, so they need extra stuff more than the RD does D) People can use NTSL/telecomms without having to use up a head role to fuck off all round and do so. As I said,the RD already has plenty of work he should be overseeing. Also, because there is no reliable way to get to the voidsuits other than praying to the RNG god while being lost in space, removed them from the possible list of objectives. It also made little sense to be stealing old NASA gear that didn't even belong to NT in the first place. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@5743 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 - Replacing the existing replace proc for NTSL with a copy of the HELPER replace text proc with some safety loops. - Turned down cache lifespan to 1. This will help the server when it has to constantly have people download the resource files and the dynamic cache. - I was seriously upset about the server room in the new telecomms not being airless. As Kor allowed anyone to make the room airless, I did so. It shouldn't be a room anyone can walk into without the necessary equipment.

 Made telecomms machines not heat the air around them. This reduces telecomms machinery processing (no checking for/generating heat) and reduces atmos processing (that large telecomms room isn't constantly being heated by telecomms then cooled by the freezer). I'm sure people are gonna yell about immullsions or something or casualizing or dumbing down, but we can't keep adding new systems forever while not simplifying or removing anything and expect the game to stay playable. tl;dr telecomms heating/cooling has pretty much zero impact on gameplay but was constantly processing. Updated the map to give the telecomms room normal tiles and put the voidsuits back on the old satellite. If anyone is seriously upset about the telecomms room having air they're welcome to make it have airless tiles as long as they don't re-add telecomms machine heating/cooling.

 Committing most of Incoming's proposed commit: http://forums.nanotrasen.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=12229 Adds lipoplasty, plastic surgery and gender reassignment surgery. Adds a var/target_must_be_fat to the surgery datum, for surgeries exclusive to fatties. Adds a var/always_advance to the surgery step datum, for when it should advance to the next step even on failure. Adds /proc/get_location_accessible(), which is used by surgery to make sure you have access to the area you're operating on. It's a fairly horrible, but it's not called that often, so it should be fine. Correct me if I'm wrong.

 Food processors now dump out extract when a slime is processed. Replaced the surgery stuff in xenobio with a renamed food processor. This is because A) New surgery is a bit weird with slimes B) Surgery leaves a shit ton of slime corpses behind. Should be less laggy to destroy them instead. Added a monkey recycling machine to xenobio. Feeding it monkeys will grind them up. Every 5 monkeys can be redeemed for a monkey cube. This is, again, to deal with all the bodies that pile up in xenobio. The monkey recycler and slime processor need better sprites still (currently using the gibber and food processor sprites, respectively) git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@5705 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Committing datum based surgery proper. There's a brief explanation in surgery.dm, if you want to know how it works. Basically, surgeries are now initiated by bedsheets or surgical drapes, and consist of separate steps. Appendicitis is sort of hacky, but it should work for now. I'll update it when I add processing organs. Added getbrain() and getappendix() procs, which can be used instead of checking the old (now missing) x_op_stage variables. Added a surgical apron, using old sprites by matty. Updated the map: Removed the note with spell descriptions from the wizard's den for Kor. Updated the operating room. Updated xenobio to have appropriate tools for slime surgery. Path changes: /obj/item/brain > /obj/item/organ/brain /obj/item/weapon/reagent_containers/food/snacks/appendix > /obj/item/organ/appendix /obj/item/weapon/reagent_containers/food/snacks/appendix/inflamed > /obj/item/organ/appendix git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@5703 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Added wizard apprentices/magic contracts (devoid of any madoka references due to enormous self restraint) You can buy a contract from the spellbook, same as any other artefact. Using the contract will pull a ghost (with wizard set to yes in preferences) and have them become the apprentice. The person using the contract chooses from 3 sets of 2 spells each for the new apprentice to learn. The sets are as follows: Destruction: fireball/magic missile Bluespace manipulation: jaunt/teleport Robeless: knock/mindswap The apprentice chooses their name and gets an objective to keep the wizard alive. For game ticker purposes, they count as traitors, so the round will still end if the main wizard dies. The apprentice spawns in normal blue robes and with a one use telescroll in their pocket. If the contract is unable to find a ghost to become a wizard it will remain usable until it spawns one successfully. If the wizard changes their mind/there are no ghosts available, they can attack the spellbook with an unused contract to refund their spell point. Redid the spellbook to have descriptions of spells visible before purchasing/fixed some of the cooldown times (from memory, some may still be wrong). Updated the changelog. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@5702 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

Pulsing will toggle this, cutting/mending will toggle it on/off. * The limit power wire will allow the PA to be turned up to strength 3 when cut. When pulsed it will beep. * Nothing wire will do nothing. - New particle that will be shot at strength 3. - Decreased the hidden rating of longevity. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@5693 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 - NTSL returns! Thanks muskets! I will be responsible for anything that goes wrong with NTSL. - Wire datums arrive! These are wire datums which allows you to easily add wires in a maintainable manner. All wires by default will be allowed to have a signallers attached to it. I have converted cyborg wires, airlock wires, camera wires and mulebot wires to the new system. - Cameras will no longer have random wires for each camera. The power wire will toggle the power of the camera when pulsed. - Robots have a new wire! The lockdown wire will toggle the lockdown status of robots. You can now fix cyborgs that have been locked down and had the robotics computer destroyed. Should be interesting now that you can remotely pulse all datum wires. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@5663 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Committing DAL_TG lighting tweaks for carn. http://forums.nanotrasen.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=12096 > UpdateAffectingLights() is a bit less silly. It now uses oview() to find lights which could be shining on it. It only searches a maximum of LIGHTING_MAX_LUMINOSITY_STATIC-1 away from itself, as this is all it needs to do (reducing the number of atoms it searches/lights it updates). > UpdateAffectingLights() is called more sensibly, generally it will only be called when opacity actually changes on a lit turf (or something in a lit turf), as opposed to before where it would be called simply if something was opaque. > Fixes a typo in cheap_hypotenuse(), it will now work correctly. > Added circular lighting (using cheap_hypotenuse, a cheap linear approximation of pythagoras theorem). Old square lighting is toggable by commenting out #define LIGHTING_CIRCULAR > Wall-fixed lighting will break when Move()ed. This means their lighting will not be updating whilst the singulo is on a rampage (which would cause lots of lighting updates). This should help reduce lighting updates a fair bit in such circumstances. Also the lord of darkness actually creates darkness! omg >Halved the theoretical number of calls to UpdateAffectingLights() by turfs being deleted/created (aka replaced), by moving relevant code from New/Del into ChangeTurf(). Tidied ChangeTurf up a little. >SpaceVines now update opacity correctly (this somewhat worries me though) >Reduced the range of dynamic lighting effects for most objects. Fixed the bug where mob luminosity could try to go negative when dropping many held active flashlights. >Space area no longer uses dynamic lighting. (at request) >Fewer shades of darkness (reduced from 7 to 6) - means fewer shift_to_subarea calls and makes lower luminosity lights appear brighter >Turfs can be luminous, removed the warnings. capped luminosity effects of turfs to a radius of 1. >PDAS ARE NO LONGER SUNS! >ChangeTurf() no longer replaces turfs with turfs of the same type. This means that singulos will no longer replace space with space with space over and over and over every tick >there is a cpu-usage cap thingy on the lighting process().

 - Replaced MAX_EXPLOSION_RANGE with MAX_EX_DEVASTATION_RANGE _HEAVY_ _LIGHT_ and _FLASH_. - Moved explosion capping to explosion code, overridable by setting a proc parameter, which defaults to off, obviously. - Reduced r-walls' explosion resistance from 25 to 15. They can now be destroyed by strong bombs. - Added liquid processing to the sun part of the MC - Added additional calls to atmos processing to the MC. You can enable this by (manually, with the debug controller verb) enabling the fast_atmos_1 .. 3 variables in the configuration datum.

 You can now make a single camera use multiple networks. var/network = string is now var/list/network = list(). I've also added a "network_multi" var which is a string. This is specifically for placing cameras on a map that you want to put on multiple networks. Apparently DM's map maker doesn't support lists, so just type them all in as a string and camera/initialize() will take care of the rest. Input the networks with commas seperating them, for example: "SS13,RD,Secret,Prison,Ect" I fixed a few issues while editing the cameras on the map as well. Both maps: - Re-added the telescreen in the misc research room that got removed at some point. (Thanks to Ikarrus for pointing this out) - Any room that had 2 cameras (one for each network) were merged into one camera with the new network lists. - - Permabrig-hallway (SS13, Prison) - - Every room in R&D (including robotics) (SS13, RD) - - The bomb testing range (RD, Toxins) tgstation.2.1.1.dmm: - Added a missing wire in engineering-sec (Thanks to SuperSayu for pointing this out) - Fixed some mis-orientated firelocks.

 - Major optimisations to handle_reactions(). How is this an improvement? Before we looped through every possible reaction to see if a reaction would occure with our list of reagents. Now we already make a list of reagents which can have a reactions, cutting down on searching every single time. This will decrease the loop expensive iterations from 100s to only a handful. How does it work? We format our chemical_reactions_list like this: chemical_reactions_list[reagent_id] = list() And then we fill that list of possible reactions. Thanks to Exadv1, to cut down on redundancy we only need to have a reaction in a single list at a single time, because our handle_reaction() loop will handle that.

 Alien runtimes fixes from Cael. Added a new syndicate bundle option, the smooth operator. Includes a pistol, silencer, clean up gear, and the ever essential suit and new formal shoes, with sprites by Flashkirby. Currently the shoes are only used by smooth operators, but I'm gonna ask Ikarrus to put some on the latest map when he's done with it. Changed the 9mm casing to use midbullet2, as weakbullet is just pathetic.

 - Added a basic destilery module. It currently includes three machines: A mill, a fermentary and a still. There is currently only one 'demonstration' recipe, which is: - - Use mill to turn wheat into flour - - Use flour in fermentary (along with water - you need to varedit water_level right now) - Also I know flour is not what you use to ferment. It's just a demonstration. - Produces beer. - - Use beer in still to make vodka. Same as with the fermentary, it is just for demonstration. These things are not yet available on the map. They will however be available to botanists and/or the chef. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@5539 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Updated the comms blackout event, re-adding the chance for it to create a command report with Giacom's permission. It now picks from a list of alerts with varying levels of fuckedup-ness, to try and better communicate the idea of unreliability when the crew do hear it. Increased the time between events. Updated cows so it's disarm intent to tip them over, and made chicks not offset off their turf. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@5527 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Committing for Cael_Aislinn: = Giant Spiders = - Nurses spin webs which impede progress, bundle items and mobs up in cocoons, lay eggs to create spiderlings - Nurses are slow and weak, but their bite has a chance to paralyse the victim - Spiderlings skitter about and eventually grow into giant spiders. - Spiderlings will ventcrawl, so they can spread over the station pretty fast. - Hunters are fast, have decent health and the most effective poison - Guards are medium speed but the health and direct damage - The poison of hunters and guards can cause hallucinations if they bite you = Farm animals = - Cows can be milked or butchered for a large supply of meat. Sadists can also tip them over (with intent_help). - Goats can also be milked, but have a nasty temperament. - Chicks grow up to be chickens, who lay eggs and continue the cycle. But where did it start? (they're very noisy). - All three are orderable via QM. My changes: - Added a spider infestation event. - Optimized code with spiders and simple_animals. - Made a /hostile/retaliate type which will only fight back when hurt. Based on Cael's code. - Added some farm animals on the map. - Changed events, added a setup() proc which can let you setup variables or the event. Made the event only kill itself when it has called, announce(), start() and end(). - Brainrot will only need alkysine as a cure. - Communication blackout will always be silent. - Changed some admin buttons to use the new event system. - Added a forceEvent proc which you can use when you enable debug verbs. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@5525 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 -Breathing plasma will now give you the plasma reagent for toxic damage which will need treatment, in order to remove it from your body quickly. This creates a nice poison effect. -Made the plasma reagent damage you more. -Syndicate agent cards will now work inside pdas/wallets. -Switched some comments around in event.dm -There was a bug with a local variable list which became null, the problem was that there is no where in the code which could've nulled it. My only theory is that not having . = list() first maybe caused problems, but it seems unlikely. I changed it anyway and I'll keep watch for it re-appearing. -Fixed a bug with the new firedoors not keeping out heat, since they have an opacity of 0.

 Added a new events system! The old one still exists, mainly so the associated admin buttons still work. At some point I'll add a nice little panel for event stuff and remove the old procs. event.dm is pretty well commented, and it should be pretty easy to figure it out. Casualties of the change are space dust (which should probably be implemented separately if we want it back), the black hole event (which was awful), space ninjas (which didn't turn up), ionstorms (the non-admin ones sucked anyway) and CLANG, which I will probably add at some point, if no one else does first. Also, I removed pierott's throat from the disease outbreak list. f that s. Thanks to Sukasa and BS12, as my system is loosely based off of theirs.

 -Now instead of just giving an angry message, any living mob with a client and the nuke disk that hits a transition on Z1 on them will have their momentum reversed, effectively sending them back where they came from. (Dead and clientless mobs still have the disk deleted from them) Fixes Issue 1183 -Most game-specific messages now print to all non-new_player mobs instead of the world, round-end reports are unchanged but request consoles and other announcements will not be heard by people in the lobby any more Fixes Issue 1158 -Tweaked the temperature resistance of mechs to be more inline with current fires. Most mechs protect almost as well as a full fire suit, and the firefighter mech is just over 2x more effective Fixes Issue 1027 -False-walls can no longer be fixed when on top of a dense turfs Fixes Issue 1196 -Tweaked how damage was read for CPR and self-examining so you can't perform CPR on yourself at 100 damage Fixes Issue 1202 -Made stun-glove construction use the cable/Use() instead of just amount-2, so you can no longer get 0 amount coils Fixes Issue 1206 -Glass reagent containers and droppers now log attacks like syringes do, with the list of reagents Fixes Issue 1234 git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@5508 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Committing suomynonAyletamitlU's storage item standardisation commit: http://forums.nanotrasen.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=11746 Standardization of the object tree and some modified functionality. Moved a lot of storage/*_kit and similar boxes to storage/box/* ; most of these can now be found in boxes.dm. First aid kits remain a separate item type. Replacement Light boxes pick up lights (for example broken ones) when used on them Moved weapon/secstorage to storage/secure Moved plant bags, ore satchel, trash bag, and sheet snatcher to storage/bag, in bags.dm Fixed reagent_containers and snacks to pass through attackby() so the use_to_pickup code works. This affects plant bags, trash bags, and pill bottles. Dice packs are now pill bottles, and all pill bottles can pick up dice. Added error handling to uplink/generate_menu() so that one mistyped string doesn't bork the whole syndie uplink menu, since strings cannot be type-checked at compile time. Cigarette packs and crayon boxes are now storage/fancy, however they retain existing update_icon() code. Added a comment to storage.dm so that future people know where to look for use_to_pickup and allow_quick_gather code. Updated all maps.

 Committed Cael Aislinn's proposed commit: http://forums.nanotrasen.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=11641 - Xenos suit and helm (completely obscuring, and almost indistinguishable from drones) (admin spawned only for now). - Facehuggers now have different icon states for being thrown and after impregnation. - New death, unconscious and sleeping icons for aliens. - New icon (and projectile type) for neuroxotin. - New infection overlay images for telling aliens about pregnant humans (3 icons, showing the progression of the infestation). - New system for handling alien impregnation (alien embryos are an object inside the mob, instead of a disease). - Players can be operated surgically to remove the alien embryos (targetting the chest: scalpel, surgical saw, hemostat, retractors. If the embryo is nearly fully developed, it might come out alive though. - Corgis can now get impregnated. - There is a short animated overlay of a chestburster when it comes time to burst chests. - Alien larva now have three different icon sets, depending on their growth (25% they are bloody and pale, 25% - 75% they are pale, 75% onwards they are deep red). Fixed up table smashing, and added rack smashing in the same way. Added new north/south facing for the large alien queen. Updated the changelog. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@5493 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 -Added a config option, which defaults to off, which will let the gamemodes Wizard, Malf and Rev carry on playing without round interruption. Meaning... The wizard round will carry on even if the wizard dies The malf round will carry on even if the AI dies. When the AI dies the shuttle will become callable. If the AI takesover the station or causes the station to explode, the round will end like normal. Rev will carry on playing even when all heads or all rev heads die. The shuttle will become callable when this is true. -Properly fixed the PDA runtime without adding special snowflakes. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@5489 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 - Moved access definitions for jobs to the job datum. In addition, I added an extra access definition: minimal_access and access. Minimal access is intended for servers with large populations. All jobs have the bare minimum access they need to survive. access, on the other hand, is a far more generous list of accesses, intended for servers with lower populations, where players are expected to do more than just the job they were assigned. Also for servers which don't want to allow people to hide in their own ultra secure departments, where no one can get to them. I did not go through the list to assign 'access' yet, so the two are currently identical. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@5479 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 -Added a new button to NTSL's IDE which will clear the server's memory. -Changed the broadcast function using a precreated human. The human would still be existing and a new one was created for every use of the broadcast. Garbage collecting it was almost impossible and deleting it everytime a broadcast is made would be laggy so I modified the broadcast code to not need a mob reference. -Added some checks in the events. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@5477 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Added three new slime reactions. Made slimes emote less often. Found a better way to fix the runtimes I'd been getting, most cores delete on being used again. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@5474 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Fixed slime extract related runtimes. Apparently it didn't like having them get deleted as part of the chem reaction. To make it easier to deal with all the extracts that are gonna be laying about, made it so using a slime extract changes the name to "used slime extract" (this means you can store used ones neatly and separately within the slime fridge). git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@5473 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Added a smart fridge variety that holds slime extracts and placed it in xenobio. Touched up xenobio/misc research a bit more adding missing lights (and a few missing blast doors, whoops) git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@5472 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 You can now commit suicide using certain items! There will be more items to come, this really just lays the groundwork. Credit goes to CodenameB and Spike68 for the original proposed commit. Althought it ended up changing, this commit still uses all of their suicide messages. Thanks to carn for pseudo-coding the base of the system that I ended up using to implement this. The suicide verb checks the item in your active hand and calls that item's suicide_act(). (/obj/item/proc/suicide_act(mob/user)) The proc displays the suicide message to any viewers and returns a damage type. The suicide verb then applies 175 damage to the mob divided by the number of damage types. If the proc returns null (meaning that the item does not have a suicide_act() defined) the regular suicide occurs. To any coder wanting to add items to this: - You MUST return one or more damage types. "return (BRUTELOSS|FIRELOSS)" for example. - Please do not manually type in the item's name; use [src] to refrence an it instead. It'll save time down the road if an item gets renamed. It also helps handle any child of that item without copy/pasting the proc to each child. - Please do not use 'usr' for anything. Parrots can now see which item they are holding onto in the stat panel. The toy crossbow should once again work properly. Fixes Issue 1227. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@5468 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 runtime logs automatically log to data/logs/runtime/YYYY-MM.txt fixed giveruntimelog getruntimelog and getserverlog Any admin with ADMIN rights can give anybody permission to view runtimes simply by typing .giveruntimelog The person given permission can then type .getruntimelog Admins can type .getruntimelog without giving themselves permissions first Moved a lot of the copypasta code into helper procs in __HELPERS/files.dm. There is one which allows a client to browse through folders on the server (in this case to look for logfiles). You can now also return to the directory you started at. Note, for some weird reason, runtimes will no longer show in dreamdeamon. If this is a massive problem I can make it a compile option or something (or you can comment out the line if you're a coder). I know this is a massive pain but it sort of removes much of the effort in getting runtimes from other servers, since they all now have their runtimes saved in a way coders can easily access. It also sort of means we don't have to rely on people remembering to log runtimes and such. And all logs will be organised by month. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@5466 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Too remove potential excessive garbage collection per tick. We will be reusing lists for overlays instead of deleting and creating them. the .Cut() proc on a list will empty a list by default.

 Moved stuff about in xenobio. The stuff related to the slime extracts is now where the egg hatching room was (which no longer had a reason to exist, sorry Giacom I know you wanna gas people). Gave them a water tank for their extinguisher as well. Slightly increased the slimes chance to mutate when reproducing. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@5461 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Fixed the icon states of the slime mutant race people. Had not changed their names correctly from when Phoal gave them to me. Made adult slimes split into two baby slimes on death (no mutation chance, the list of friends doesn't pass over, and they'll start very hungry). git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@5460 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Portable generators will not remake powernets everytime a wrench is used on it. Got rid of the reliability factors for generating power or critically failing. Increased the time factor for each sheet for all generators. Added some feedback stuff such as saying which fuel the generator takes and how much power is in the current powernet, that it is connected to. Powernet making will not wire up "power" machines that are not anchored. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@5458 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Moved the defines of damtype from /obj/items and /obj/mecha to only /obj. This fixes a fuckload of runtimes and makes structures and machinery being able to cause damage on attackby procs, for example, using TK. I'm not entirely happy of doing this, adding another var to a base class, but it's better than leaving a lot of hasvar() procs and it's easier than moving obj/machinery, obj/structure, etc, to obj/object/machinery, obj/object/structure, etc. Also it doesn't break the entire game. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@5457 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Added 13 types of slimes/changed slime reproduction to give mutation chances on birth. Added 13 core types with a mix of old and new reactions. Each slime has its own core type/reaction. Added plasma sheets/a grinder to xenobio. Added Phoal's slime people sprites. Added simple animal pet slimes (one of the core types allows you to obtain them). Updated the changelog Still to come: slime types having their own temperature resists/special attacks. This is all probably unbalanced as well but we'll see how it goes. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@5454 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 -Made firesuits effective again by changing the proc which damages the humans due to the flames to fire_act(). The flames themselves will hurt people, who are directly on top of it, but if they're wearing a firesuit the damage is much less. -Added some procs for getting IDs and getting access. Helps clean it up so we don't have "istype(A, IDCARD) OR istype(A, PDA)" everywhere. -Made wallets equip able in the ID slot and be able to be used as an ID. -Added a PACMAN generator in Engineering to jump start the Singularity if they run out of power. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@5450 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 - yearly admin verb cleanup: moved the rejuvenate verb to debug verbs due to lack of use and using sorting code in determining which mobs have it. Moved the 'show traitor panel' to debug verbs. Still accessible from 'show player panel', so it's just one click away. Completely removed 'sendmob' due to using two separate sorting functions to determine what it's tied to.

 Added mimics! There's the classic crate (chest) mimic which waits until somebody is close before trying to attack them. You can fill him with loot by putting items on him on your map. This was done by changing the base initialize proc to an /atom/movable and then instead of looping through the world for objects, instead loop for atom movables. The next type of mimic is for the staff of animation! They will copy the icon of the object they're copying and will set themselves stats based on the object too. They will not attack the bearer of the staff which made them animated. Added the option to get the staff on the wizard's spell book. Added a "friends" var to hostile mobs. It will make the simple animal ignore friends when choosing targets. Changed the statues from /obj/effect/showcase to /obj/structure/showcase. Added a new variable to projectiles, "shot_from" is the gun that shot the projectile. It's used to determine what staff animated the mob and it will then add that staff, so it can ignore it when choosing targets. Added a wander var for simple animals, turning it to 0 will stop the simple animal from moving when idle. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@5246 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Added emp_act() to some machines. - Cell charger: Now calls battery emp_act() as well. - Security Barrier: Now has a chance to toggle the lock. - Flasher (portable and wall mounted machines, not the item): Now has a chance to flash. - Wall-Mounted Sparker: Creates sparks. - Light switch: Toggles the lights when emp'd (not that it'll matter since the lights will probably all have gone out anyway.) - Weapon Recharger: Calls the energy gun's battery's emp_act() for guns and in the case of stun batons, it sets their charges to 0. - Cyborg Recharge Station: Cyborgs now get ejected, then emp'd. There would probably be issues with emping the cyborg inside the machine, like being trapped forever or something. - Sleeper: Eject's the patient. I kind of wish I could make it inject random chems, but it wants a usr and I'm not inclined to start mucking with sleeper code just for this. - Space Heater: Calls the emp_act() for the battery inside the heater. - Status Display: Causes the blue screen of death. - Portable Atmos Pumps: Randomly changes the pressure, has a chance to flip the direction and turn the machine on/off. - Portable Atmos Scrubber: Has a chance to toggle the machine on/off. - Arcade Machine: Spits out some random prizes. - Medical record computer: Runs through the medical records and has a chance to scramble the name, age, sex, blood type, physical or mental state of patients as well as a small chance to delete entries entirely. - Security record computer: Runs through the security records and has a chance to scramble the name, age, sex, criminal status, physical or mental state of entries as well as a small chance to delete entries entirely. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@5237 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

New access levels in the brig: -Brig access now opens the front doors of the brig, as well as other lower-risk security areas. -Security access allows you into the break room and equipment lockers. -Holding Cells allows you to use brig timers and lets you in the Prison Wing. -The Detective no longer has Security Equipment access. Significantly increased max cloneloss penalty for fresh clones to 40%. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@5196 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Added a new symptom with a high level, so that it's not possible to gain through mutations. Gave the high level symptoms their own preset diseases and added them to the virus crate, along with a bottle of mutagen. Several disease fixes, such as disease stages going below 0. Diseases which spread by blood will longer spread when you touch someone (i.e: click on someone) I also did some cleaning up with comments. Made handheld radios broadcast if their messages aren't sent on the same level as they're on, meaning that turning off the relay to the station will not make it impossible to communicate with others with radios. Made some events only effect people on the station Z level. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@5192 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 New unarmed beartrap sprites by Cheri. Slightly improved beartrap code while I was there, mostly standardisation and formatting stuff as usual. Fixed the Chaplain's PDA spawn. Reduced the chance of stealthy hulk wall smashing. All but one of the messages will attempt to go over the radio now. Changed hulk resist text colour to red because it was barely readable in green. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@5191 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Improved window code, mostly formatting and styles, but also general improvements. I've tested it a fair bit, but there may be bugs, so please report those if you run into them. Added an ismetroidadult() helper Improved L6 code. Made the syndie shuttle console impervious to bullets. Made mirrors breakable. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@5187 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Removed the MASKINTERNALS from /obj/item/clothing/mask flags. There is no reason for -every- mask to act as internals. Added an issilicon() check to the PDA's remove id/pen verbs so that the AI can no longer be rendered helpless if they happen to click the 'Remove Pen' verb. Fixes issue 1124. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@5186 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Sending a message should no longer work if you are incapacitated. Fixes issue 1120. Moved some mob vars to carbon: mob/var/handcuffed -> mob/living/carbon/var/handcuffed mob/var/legcuffed -> mob/living/carbon/var/legcuffed As a result, I've turned some procs into pure virtual procs and moved their code into carbon.dm. mob/proc/restrained() -> mob/living/carbon/restrained() mob/proc/can_use_hands() -> mob/living/carbon/can_use_hands() The hand and legcuff portion of mob/proc/u_equip() was moved into mob/living/carbon/u_equip(). The handcuffed portion of mob/proc/show_inv() was moved into mob/living/carbon/show_inv(). Fixes issue 1114. Made parrots immune to bear traps since parrots should be flying over them anyway. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@5184 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 TELECOMMUNICATION Improvements to Telecomms. I wasn't happy with my relays and having telecomms send several messages on different Z levels was not effecient. I decided to overcome this by removing the need to attach Broadcasters and Transmitters to relays. Then I made relays just add to the signal data which z levels the message will be broadcasted on, instead of sending the message several times. It's a bit hard to explain but basically it should be better then ever, and adding more relays will not create serious performance issues. Since you can't control whether the Z level could only receive messages or only send them, I added options on the relay itself so you can set it. I then made an additional feature, which Nodrak gave me the idea for, which is that busses can change the frequency of a signal. It's an option on the Bus and you can set it to change the signal's frequency, which can create hilarious situations such as the command channel being redirected to the general channel. No way to duplicate a signal with a different frequency at the moment. Since relays earlier depended on a stupid system in order to become a off-site relay, I instead just made it limited to the satellite Z level, which makes more sense. Broadcasters and Receivers are linked to the HUB, but it's still possible to create a simple telecommunication system with a "Receiver -> Bus -> Processer -> Broadcaster" (though it will be slow) OTHER Smartfridge limit was lowered to 999, just below the infinite loop check limit. This is to prevent further issues that may occure. Moved creating some icon datums above the SQL procs, just to make sure that the SQL itself isn't sleeping and causing issues with the datums being used before being loaded. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@5183 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Ported syndicates over to hostile simple animals. Replaced the old syndicates in the new ones in all the away missions. Removed a now unused "issyndicate" proc. Ported the obstacle smashing over to hostile animals. This means carp will attempt to break into escape and stuff now. Scary!

 Added a "faction" var to mobs. This var gets checked when hostile simple animals attack something. Default is "neutral." Changed the hostile code to allow for ranged mobs. Will port syndies over to hostile at some point (I don't want to go and replace the syndies on all the away maps right now). Added pirate simple animals for Inti (icons are from him). Icons for russians and an on mob bear belt are in as well. There is a ranged version and a melee version. Set factions for constructs, shades, carp, bears, faithless. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@5176 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Shadow mutantrace can see in the dark. Updated Brotemis's map with his final changes. This involves shuffling about the final room and adding a bunch of diary papers to explain what is going on.

 Merged listen_ooc, seeprayers, STFU_ghosts, STFU_radio, deadchat, sound_adminhelp, ghostears, ghostsight, canplaysound, midis, no_ambi and lobby_music into client.prefs.toggles as bitflags. Toggling these preferences in-game will update your savefile. Meaning that your preferences will persist between rounds. Added some savefile_version updating stuff. It's pretty crude. If you're changing any of the savefile stuff just ask and I can change it/help. Removed some unused client vars Ghosts no longer hear ambience. Simplified ambience code. Simplified lobby music code. It will no longer cause a massive queue of events (which would eventually balloon in memory use) Moved ooccolor and sound_adminhelp back to prefs. It's easier and allowed me to remove the setupclient() stuff completely. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@5143 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 -Got rid of a redundant del() in the PANDEMIC. Fixes Issue 1116. -Added a new symptom. Voice Change will randomly change the voice of the affected mob. It isn't obtainable by Mutagen and I'll likely put it in the virus crate when I have more dangerous viruses. -Added two new symptom procs. Start() will be called once and it'll be called when the advance disease processes. Allows you to setup stuff for your symptom. End() will be called before the disease is deleted. -Diseases that spread by blood won't spread by contact anymore. You will need to directly inject someone to get them to catch the disease. -Put a limit on shivering and fevers. -Added a specialvoice variable. You can use SetSpecialVoice() to set a special voice that the player will say instead. To unset it, use UnsetSpecialVoice(). GetSpecialVoice() will return the player's special voice value. -Added two DEFINEs for the limit which is how much a human can take before taking burn damage from heat or coldness. -Some symptom value changes. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@5136 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Added Exile Implants. Someone implanted with an Exile Implant will be able to enter the away mission, but unable to return from it. Not only can they be used for getting rid of dangerous criminals, but revs/stationheads count as dead while on the away mission, and traitor/changeling/wizard assassination targets count as dead if they're on the away mission at round end, allowing for those objectives to be completed peacefully. Added a locker of exile implants to the gateway room. Added a health analyzer to virology. Replaced the teleport scroll in station collision with a cultist space suit/helmet. This is both because a teleport scroll is sorta overpowered in general and because it would allow people to easily return from exile. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@5133 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 -Added some visual hit indication by having a variable be set to 20 when the mob takes brute or fire damage. It will then be added to the health calculation, in the overlay code, and then it will reset to 0. Thus making a cool effect. -Removed the waiting for light replacers. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@5132 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Balance change: Malf AIs can't shunt from APC to APC and must first return to their core. They can also start a takeover from their APC now. This is a test run with it and if people don't like it I'll remove it. General work to advance diseases. -Changed the possible cures to a list which is ordered from easiest to cure to -hardest to cure. -Some tweak valuables to symptoms. -Air alarms will update their window when you cut/pulse wires. -Re-added analysers to mechanical (blue) toolboxes. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@5125 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Mutes are now in datum/preferences. That means they are persistent! You can't avoid them by logging out you naughty little spammers. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@5124 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Re-added warnings. Admins can now give players formal warnings via the player panel. Even when they are offline. These warnings can no longer be reset by logging out. The number of strikes a person gets is a define so hosts can modify it to their liking (I should probably move this to a config option but I can't be bothered to test it again). It defaults to 3 strikes, on the third strike you're out. It'll autoban you for 10 minutes. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@5123 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 SANITY: Created a series of generalised sanity procs. They can be found in code/__HELPERS/sanitize_values.dm They include such procs as sanitize_integer(num, min, max, default) which will check num is a number, round num to make it an integer, then check if it is between min and max (inclusive). If it fails the bound-checks it will return default. There are others, have a look. PERSISTENT PREFERENCES: Every ckey which connects to the game gets its own persistent /datum/preferences datum. It is archived in var/list/preferences_datums = list("ckey" = datum) At connect it is automatically associated with the client defines.dm (or a new one is created if it can't find an archived prefs datum). This means clients will ALWAYS have a var/datum/preferences/prefs which references this datum. So you can use it without checking if(client.prefs) This has simplified only a few bits of code. It will however, allow us to make preferences like see_deadchat ghost_ears etc, persistent. So they will not reset when you DC. SAVEFILES: Changed the player savefile code a lot. Hopefully I've not fucked it up too much. Every single variable loaded from saves is now sanity checked using the new sanity procs. This should help prevent savefiles becomming obsolete by sanitizing input to meet current requirements, without deleting all the ok variables and making you start from scratch >_> NOTE: I still need to sort out the savefile version stuff. I'll probably figure it out before the server updates anyway. It sees to be fine without it. You can no longer choose your blood type. It is randomised (with each bloodtype having a realistic probability of occuring). This is to make blood analysis (detective/medical) less pointless. It is chosen as soon as you connect. It remains persistent throughout each round so you won't be able to change it by logging in/out over and over. Replaces some copypasta code with is_afk() (still a fair bit to do) There are new hyperlink shortcut things. _src_=vars will direct your hyperlink to viewvars. _src_=prefs to your preferences datum. (These are the only way to access those bits of code via links). This means that the overall amount of operations in almost every Topic has pretty much halved and is much prettier. Replaced and removed adminplayervars from datum/admins/Topic. It was superfluous. They now all point directly to the viewvars code using _src_=vars Removed the changelog popup at round start. Instead a button on your game-window will glow white if there are new updates. To peruse at your convenience. This will speed up connect times. Removed the AFK_THRESHOLD define. It is integrated into is_afk() now. TODO: remove the prefs stuff from mobs and clients and update code to use client.prefs to access that info. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@5121 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Moved shuttle_engines.dm to the unused folder as it has apparently been unticked for ages. Moved the modified wish granter and meat grinder from Brotemis' away mission map (wildwest) into wildwest.dm in the random z-level folder.

 Ported over BS12 style cameras, which photograph a 3x3 area. It's fuckin radical. Removed /obj/item/weapon/camera while I was at it (unused). New cameras are in modules/paperwork/photography.dm. Standardised folder and paper naming a leetle bit. Added a new gamekit sprite, also from BS12. Path changes! /obj/item/weapon/camera_test > /obj/item/device/camera Updated all maps with the path changes, excepting oldstation.dmm.

 message_admins() now only has one argument. The message you want to send. The find and replaces for %holder_ref% -> src=\ref[C.holder] and %admin_ref% -> src=\ref[C] are no longer needed. Instead we will be using _src_=holder to direct to holder and src= to direct to client (not needed, you can just omit the src parameter completely in your link) git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@5112 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Removed the old style asteroid turfs. Removed a lot of old and unused turf sprites. Removed some old botany sprites (fucking cocoa pods). Replaces the lava turf sprite with a good one. Adds a lot of Ausops' snow sprites. Defines for these coming soon. I might have been overzealous with the turf removal, so if anything was actually used, feel free to just revert, or add back the sprites. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@5106 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Added a switch inside client/Topic which can direct the topic call to a few frequently used destinations. Before, when making a link to an admin tool, you done this: <a href='?src=\ref[C.holder];parameter=1;>link</a> Now, we do not need to use a reference to direct it to places like usr or usr.client.holder (or client, but you never needed src for that anyway) usr: <a href='?_src_=usr;parameter=1;>link</a> holder: <a href='?_src_=holder;parameter=1;>link</a> This basically allows us to move a LOT of code outside of loops as we no longer have to create a \ref for every recipient of the message. They can all be sent identical links. A simple example of this would be in pray.dm Although it's most noticeable in the adminhelp code which is vastly simplified. Adminhelp name spotting code thingy...whatever... looks for ckey matches first, then surnames, then forenames. This is to stop it possibly weirding out if there is a station full of "Ed"s of "Sarah"s Prayer code no longer loads a new icon into memory every time a prayer is sent. Use image() not icon()! key_name() no longer needs a reference for it's admin_link argument. message_admin() pretty much doesn't need those extra arguments for finding and replacing %holder_ref%. I've got to go through all the code to check before I remove it though. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@5105 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 -You can now name your advance diseases. You can only name unnamed diseases. -Removed the mutagen requirement from a metroid recipe so it does not conflict with the mix_virus recipe. -When deaf, you'll get a notice when you see someone talking but you don't hear them. Being blind and deaf will give you no message, because you won't be able to tell. Talking while deaf will give you a message, even while blind. -Diseases can't be cured by having a high body temperature now. -I cut down the copy+paste on the meter code. -Advance diseases now have a limit of 3 in a single mob, increased the amount of symptoms you can have to compensate. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@5069 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Couple of bugfixes: Wizards can no longer cast spells when muzzled. Fixes issue 843. You can no longer take bags of holding or mechs to the clown planet. Fixes issue 1061. Removed the infared sensor from the autolathe construct list. Fixes issue 1092. - The infared sensor already does nothing, the code for it seems to have been removed ages ago, so there's no harm in doing this. - Commenting out the define caused a few problems that I couldn't quite figure out. I'll leave it for now with a warning. Removed the ability for pAI's to set arrest status. Dead players really shouldn't be allowed to grief people like that. Fixes issue 1093. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@5060 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Removed the alertness level thing for carp/hostile mobs in general. Neat idea in theory, but in practice it just meant people could run up and beat carp to death before they'd even enter their hostile state. Bears still have it though. Carp are slightly faster (in testing, I walked away from one as a borg, this seems a bit silly). This might not work well in practice though what with lag on a live server, so I'm guessing I might have to change this back. Carp/syndicate also keep chasing their target as long as they're within 10 tiles, to compensate for them being slower than humans. Removed the restriction on debraining changelings, this was a terrible "fix" to half-changelings and just lets you metagame. Added a mineral var (metal) to floors to stop runtimes when you hit them with mining tools. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@5052 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Lots of bugs fixed for advance diseases. Fixed advance diseases using the same reference in mobs. Fixed advance diseases referencing other advance diseases' symptoms, instead of just copying it. I tested it more thoroughly this time and I can't find any issues but if you do please add them to the bug tracker and or contact me on #coderbus. Added a new reaction which will remove symptoms from a disease. Needs blood and synaptizine. Added a new symptom, shivering will make you cold. Tweaked and balanced some symptoms. Removed the "flex" emote that hulks will do randomly. Reduced the change to speak for hulks and brain damaged mobs. ( 7% -> 3% chance) Please let me know if anything is out of place or wrong. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@5048 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Removed the toggle_gravity_on() and toggle_gravity_off() verbs and moved them into a single toggle in the FUN section of the secrets panel. Likewise, removed the spawn_xeno verb and made an equivalent bit of code in the FUN section of the secrets panel. Fixed the create_xeno proc. It was supposed to ask you which type of alien to spawn but it was sending the popup to src, which should have been usr. Create_xeno can now spawn queens and larva. Create_xeno is fed a ckey (optional) rather than a ghost mob. Which will make it more versatile and reliable should clients log out during popups and such. Created an client.is_afk(duration) proc. If the client has been inactive for duration frames (11 frames is roughly 1 second), it will return the number of frames it has been inactive. Otherwise it returns 0. If no duration value is given it defults to 3000 which is roughly 5 minutes. There's a bunch of code I need to replace with this which I will do after I've got the rest of the admin rank stuff finished as that takes priority. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@5040 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Using summon guns gives a message to the the user to confirm it working. Added a new borg upgrade module which requires illegal tech and combat tech to make. It allows you to give them their emagged equipment without fucking with their laws. New LMG by Ausops (both sprites and code). Right now appears only in Summon Guns, but may appear elsewhere in time. Grilles now have a bullet act, so they no longer magically absorb infinite bullets. Updated changelog. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@5037 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Game Panel is now available to all admins regardless of rights (spawning from that panel requires +SPAWN, and changing game mode requires +ADMIN) Player panel (for an individual mob) is available to all admins regardless of rights (like above, each link on the page has its own rights requirements) Essentially, with no rights you can see these panels, but you cannot use most of the tools they link to. Additional rights increase your access to corresponding tools. Removed some duplicate code in /datum/admins/Topic for subtle messages, traitor panel and a few others. There's a lot more to do in this regard but it can wait for now. We're near the end of the disruption now. I sort of have a clear idea what I'm meant to be doing so work will speed up. Full documentation describing exactly what can and can't be done with each flag will be available soon. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@5035 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 - Fixes the broken population logging - The current, file-based ban system is now a legacy system, the use of which is strongly discouraged for servers, which are constantly online. - Added a database-based banning system, with a new baning panel, accessible through the 'banning panel' verb. Servers, which use this new banning system, will get the new panel up even if they use the old 'unban panel' or 'display job bans' verbs. These remain there for legacy support purposes. (Panel screenshot below) - The most notable benefits of the new system are the ability to add offline bans, meaning the person does not have to be connected for a ban to be applied to their name. The second benefit is the ability to look up all previous bans that the person had. - The major disadvantage is the complete incompatibility between the old and new system, meaning you have to either do a lot of copy-pasting or playing around in code to sync the old system with the new one. Servers upgrading to this system might want to consider a purge of all bans, if they don't want to go through this. Due to the incompatibility, there are no transition tools provided. Please contact me (errorage/rageroro) in #coderbus for help in syncing your database. The /tg/ legacy and database systems have been synced. - The server configuration defaults to use the legacy system, as the new one requires the database to be set up. Please hash BAN_LEGACY_SYSTEM in config.txt as explained, to use the new system. If the database connection fails, the server reverts to the legacy system. If any bugs or errors appear with either the legacy or new ban system, please let me know ASAP. The same applies if there are any syncronization problems between the legacy and new system, resulting in banned people unbanned or unbanned people banned.

 - Fixed the revision number not showing properly. Hopefully it's fixed for good this time, as it works off of logic, instead of line numbers. - Standardized the database library code - Deleted a few unused database related files (karma and forum activation), so they won't get in my way later. They work off of no longer existent database tables. - Made it so the server maintains a constant connection with the database, which is established on world/New() and never broken, until the server ends. If 5 consecutive database connection attempts result in no connection getting established, the server will not attempt any more connections. Made all existing database connections use the global continuous connections. Currently we need two, as we have two databases, but the old database is going to get moved into the new one. - Fixed the spaghetti-like report in the permissions panel, which happened when someone had many permissions enabled. - Added database connection reports to display to dream daemon on server startup. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@5015 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 - Added a new permission type called 'ADVDEBUG', which contains the debug verbs, which should really not be available to run-of-the-mill admins, but should be available to coders, who can use them properly. (debug-verbs and advanced proc call). - Moved 'reload admins' into the SERVER permission. It already had a check for R_SERVER when it was run, so it being in the debug list was likely a typo. There should probably be an ADVANCEDADMIN permission type or something, that contains the admin-related tools that you don't want all admins to have access to. A 'game masters only' list of verbs, so to speak. - Edited admin_ranks.txt and the other dm files accordingly. - Standardized diagnostics.dm PS: I really love permission based admin verb assignment. So much easier to work with! git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@5012 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 - Reverted the size reduction from r4996. This is simply not acceptable: - http://www.kamletos.si/screen%20overlay%20reduced%20size.png - http://www.kamletos.si/screen%20overlay%20reduced%20size2.png- Made being in an area with extremely low pressure cause some damage (2 per tick) - Reduced the amounts of oxy damage per tick from 1/ 2 / 4 to 0.5 / 1.5 / 3, depending on your body temperature. - Reduced the maximum amount of high pressure damage per tick from 7 to 4. Slightly reduced the damage coefficient for pressure damage. This is to prevent insta-kills in high pressure areas. I still can't believe poly originally set it to 20 per tick... - Added a maximum amount to how much your body temperature can change in each tick. It can go up or down by, at most, 30K per tick. - Space suits and the captain's armor now protect against pressure damage - Fixed some more of poly's awful code. The STOPSPRESSUREDMAGE flag now defines whether you take damage or not. You still need to have both a helmet and suit with that flag on to be fully protected from pressure damage. This will make the pressure damage indicator actually show what kind of pressure is affecting you and not just pretend like you're not taking damage, even if you are, while in a space suit: //Poly code<TM> if(istype(wear_suit, /obj/item/clothing/suit/space)||istype(wear_suit, /obj/item/clothing/suit/armor/captain)) --pressure.icon_state = "pressure0" else --... - Standardized /obj/item/examine(). - Added the important stuff to the changelog. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@5004 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 -New sprites APC sprites by TankNut! -New wraith sprites by TankNut! -Decreased flare duration, again(!) -Made a based interact proc and changed the updateDialog to call that instead of attack_hand. This caused issues with the APC and getting the power cell out of it.

 -Fixed Issue 864 (Moving lights from your inventory to your hand causes lumiosity to be subtracted from your mob.) Item's attack_hand proc wasn't calling the item to be picked up if it was in your inventory, which meant that the lights couldn't update properly. By calling pickup, even if the mob was taking it from their own inventory, I was able to get the lights to update properly. I've tested all items that used /pickup and they all worked correctly, apart from tray which never worked correctly as I then tested it on the online servers. I'll create an issue report for that later. -The crew monitor will now detect mobs that are inside a content of an object, such as a locker. I also made it so that it only detected mobs on the same z level as the computer itself, so people on the away missions and what not will not be able to see the crew member's on the station. -Updated the changelog about my last commit, before this one. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4999 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 - Set z-level 6 (the empty one) to be accessible through space travel. The new transit percentages are: 1 (Station) = 5%; 3 (Satellite) = 10%; 4 (Derelict) = 15%; 5 (Mining) = 10%; 6 (Empty) = 60%. Also remember that you will always change z-level. So there will always be a maximum of one empty z-level between you and your destination. You won't just keep looping through z-level 6. (This is part of my previous commit) - Added a new admin tool to crack down on people who log out as soon as they realize they didn't get antagonist. The tool reports all clients, who have either logged out, are dead, ghosted or suicided or are AFK (IE alt+tabbed). The tool triggers 10 minutes into the round and only triggers once. You can set when this triggers by changing the ROUNDSTART_LOGOUT_REPORT_TIME define (currently set to 6000 (deciseconds)) - Fixed a bug where it was impossible to admin-set someone's health in the view vars screen. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4997 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Reduced the size of the station_explosion.dmi and screen1_full.dmi files. The rsc file will be about 8Meg smaller (so about the same size as it was a few months ago >_>) If you want to reduce the size of a dmi, you can open it in GIMP, go to colours->posterize, then export it as png to import it back into byond. If you need to split the image back into it's individual states you can set up guidelines and use filters->web->slice to slice it up into squares and automatically export it. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4996 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 - Made it possible to get to the station, derelict, satellite and mining z-levels through space travel. - You will now never loop into the same z-level on transition. So if you are exiting the derelict z-level, you won't re-enter the derelict z-level on the other side. - Added this to the changelog. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4995 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Admin ranks now use bitfields for permissions. Rather than checking the name of the rank, adminverbs will now check holder.rights to see if it has certain bits turned on. SERVER HOSTS: This commit replaces the existing admin-rank system. It is now more customizable. Admin.txt essentially works the same as it always has. Each line should look like: ckey - admin rank There is now however, an admin_ranks.txt. This textfile allows you to define ranks like so: admin rank +ADMIN +FUN +BUILD the +KEYWORD are flags adding permissions to that rank. There are brief descriptions in the text-file explaining what they do. You can now name the ranks anything you like, and give them the permissions you want them to have. This allows, for instance, ranks like: Game Admin on disciplinary +ADMIN +BAN This would give that game admin only the tools they need to admin. They would not have access to 'fun' verbs which control events and antags. There's lots of things you can do. For instance, a coder rank whom can debug stuff but cannot do admin tasks: Codermin +DEBUG +VAREDIT +SERVER There's lots you can do. As it evolves it will hopefully become more flexible. admin_ranks.txt defaults to use the old admin rank names. Apologies in advance as there will be a lot of anomalies, such as ranks losing verbs they once had. Please let me know about any problems. I can fix them quite easily simply by moving verbs between the lists or splitting the lists up into new flags. CODERS: There is now a check_rights(flags) proc. It check is usr is and admin and has -at least one of- the rights specified. It checks > usr < not src, so keep that in mind! If you need to check if something other than usr has specific tights, you can do if(holder.rights & R_ADMIN) etc. KNOWN ISSUES: +FUN probably needs to be split up into +MOBS and +EVENTS In-game promotion/demotion is currently disabled. It will be readded after everything else works ok. Erro's sql rights changes stuff is currently commented out. It will be re-added. There are still many many verbs which need updating. Apologies in advance for any inconvenience. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4991 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 -More work to advance diseases. The Pandemic should be more compatible with advance diseases. Currently it's pretty ugly but when I get rid of the broken diseases and convert the rest to advance diseases I will clean up the pandemic. Vaccines will now work properly with advance diseases. Soon I'll add a system so that you are able to name your own diseases, as I've added ways for me to do that with the archive_diseases list. Gave names to symptoms for the Pandemic. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4989 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 - Based on the 'nerf' to energy relays, they no longer require Illegal Tech to build, and instead a mech clusterbang launcher takes its place for Illegal Tech. Do note however, that this launcher cannot reload, so it would have to be replaced with a new one in order to fire again. Hopefully that would provide some semblance of balance without gimping it. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4983 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 - Added a speach_probability variable to parrots, which starts out at 10. It decreases over time, meaning that while it's speach chance is initially prob(10) in each life cycle, as soon as it succeeds, it will be prob(9) and so on, until it eventually gets to prob(1). In effect this reduces the amount of Poly spam. - Increased the time between vending machine adverts from 60s to 600s = 10 minutes. In addition, I set it so a newly created vending machine assigns a random time for it's first message to be displayed to ensure that all vending machines don't say their message at the same time. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4981 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 - Added on to most emotes so anyone 'miming' will perform silent versions of them, so mimes can now use all of the pre-existing emotes and they won't have their vows forcibly broken by diseases making them yawn or whatnot. Fixes Issue 1039 - Made the custom emote proc discard any emotes that start with "says", "asks", or "exclaims", to prevent people from impersonating others via emotes. Fixes Issue 1020 - Made the ticker call mob/living/Death() for all mobs that are currently alive on z1 for nuked station cinematics (No matter what triggered the nuke, the station being destroyed will kill everyone and make them shut up) Fixes Issue 1048 - Added a confirmation message to regenerative stasis for changelings, so that if they are not dead or unconscious a pop-up will ask them to confirm faking death.

 - Made Mech RCDs drain power when decontructing shit instead of recharging, both for consistency and the fact that it was pretty dumb. - Changed Energy Relays so that they no longer offset equipment drain to APCs while charging from them (Essentially infinite power for the most part), buffed the charge rate so it will compensate for a Ripley's movement as a benchmark. - Updated tgstation.2.0.9.dmm to remove a stray pipe that was sitting on the arrival shuttle, even though it was being deleted at round-start git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4977 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 - Made Mimewalls a seperate instance of forcefields instead of the special-snowflake-mime-dependent ones. When made, they are added to processing_objects, and count down every process() until they delete themselves(And are removed from processing_objects) Fixes Issue 1025 - Made the Nuke Disk delete itself under certain conditions when it hits a transition tile in space, specifically if it is inside a bag and NOT on a living mob's back with a client, so spaced containers, backpack on braindead body, backpack on corpse will no longer make Nuclear Emergency unwinnable. Fixes Issue 1026 - Added parse_zone() to projectile/Bump(), so instead of being hit in the "r_leg" you would be hit in the "right leg", and so on. Fixes Issue 1028 - Touched up my throw logging so that instead of doing a search through the player_list to match stuff up, it simply pulls the client from carn's directory list git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4976 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Added Skasi's changes to Xeno and Arrivals. Here's a list of changes. More changes. They can all be found on this screenshot (http://imageshack.us/a/img37/1253/monkeysandmore.png). Trying to sort them by priority/impact: Added reinforced floors to and around the roro pen since xenos are now able to destroy floors. Added a chemwhiz to chemistry. There's only been a single one in the CMO's office before that. Replaced valves in the xeno room with pumps to stop two different canisters' gases from being mixed. Added a pump to the port->roro hatch to allow fine tuning the gas dose. Replaced glass of xeno's monkey pen with walls, since the glass was blocking vision anyway to stop roros from targeting monkeys. Adjusted stripes in the mixing room to fill the r.glass positions. Removed stripes from the left and right end of the cryo room. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4959 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 -Killed the updateDialog lag. I added a check to see if there were any mobs to update, if not it will stop checking until a user uses the machine again. I had to replace all the machine = src and machine = null with procs to help make it manageable. I believe this is one of the culprits causing the server to lag as the round goes on, as more players will interact with machines. -Atmos delay is now based on active players, to help fight lag for massive player rounds. -Changed some for(blah in world) loops to use the correct lists. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4958 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Throwing eggs will result in the reagents of the egg reacting to the target. (Which can be a turf, object or mob) This creates possibilities like chloral eggs, lube eggs, and many more. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4956 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Changed some global_list stuff: >tried to make the comments less confusing. >Removed the procs for rebuilding the lists (they weren't meant to be used and half were broken anyway). >added a directory. It maps ckey to client like so directory[ckey] = client. It could be used for PMs, banning, and various other admin tools rather than using \ref[] >var/list/admins is now a list of clients whom are admins. >var/list/admin_datums is what var/list/admins used to be. A map from ckey -> admin datum Most of this is so I can add modular admin ranks in a non-horrendous way and fix some existing issues. >var/list/client_list is now var/list/clients (laziness sorry) >removed some needless loops and stuff. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4951 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 -Aliens can acid turf. The only turf they cannot acid are r_walls. I just used a typecheck because I didn't see the need for types of turf needing to be unacidable, but if so I'll make a variable for it. -Made a proc which will select active candidates. BALANCE STUFF -Acid is less random. -Humans being disarmed by Aliens is no longer a random duration, instead it is a constant 10, instead of the random 10 to 15. -Facehugger throw range was reduced to 5. -Laying eggs costs 75 plasma (from 50) and secreting resin costs 75 plasma (from 100). -Reduced stun duration of Alien disarm to Cyborgs. From 10 to 7. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4949 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

It just calls text2list(return_file_text(filepath), seperator). rather than copypasta >Replaced time_stamp() so it's not as retarded >Lots of the world setup stuff uses file2list now, rather than file2text -> sanity -> text2list >Added error() warning() testing() procs.

 New Changeling Powers! Hive Channel/Hive Absorb. Allows you to share your DNA with other changelings, very expensive chemical wise to absorb (download), not so much to channel (upload)! You cannot achieve your objective by sharing DNA. Mimic Voice! You can form your voice of a name you enter. You won't look like them but when you talk, people will hear the name of who you selected. While you're mimicing, you can't regenerate chemicals. Extract DNA! A power that allows you to silently sting someone and take their DNA! Meaning you do not have to absorb someone to become them. Extracting their DNA doesn't count towards completing your objectives. Misc: New livingmob proc GetVoice(), used by changeling mimicing and voice changers. Will return the name of the voice that should be heard by people. Got rid of the chance to "feel" like someone isn't who they are. Commented the check for someone's gender being incorrect in life. Looks like the bug hasn't re-occured since it was put in place. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4890 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 My first commit, yay! Removing: -Erro code of r4861. Xsi gave me permission p-please don't kill me. Proc added: -Added a proc that checks the rank of the admin and compares it to a var given. If the check fails, returns a 0 and a "You need more acces" message. If not, returns an 1. admin_rank_check(var/rank, var/requested) Admin option changes: -You need to be at least a trialmin to change a var in VV. -You need to be at least a trialmin to change the vars on the tator panel -You need to be at least a trialmin to allow votes or start a custom one. (All admins can cancel votes) -All mob transformations (of playerpanel and VV) and special options (like godmode), now requires trialmin status or higher. -All admins can use aghost now. -All admins can right click - VV if they are a ghosting. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4889 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 New bluespace artillery sprites by Ausops. Updated the gun/my map to use them. Fixed an error in the holo-deck logging. "overrided" is not a fucking word. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4888 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Fix for borked atmos on away missions. This may still need some further tweaking, but it definitely fixes the issue. I looked at the powernet issue too, but I couldn't reproduce it anymore. Maybe it's fixed. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4887 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 This commit is so it is possible to get a secret AI running without it being announced. -Removed the "X is your AI." message and the sound that played.

 Closets now pick up all items on the tile they're created on, the same as crates. This makes it easier for mappers to put things in lockers without making new locker types or var-editing them. Moved snowflake telecomm ambient sound code that only half worked into the switch that's designed to handle it. Committing for Aranclanos: - Toggle ambience should now properly work. Fixes issue 992. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4880 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Mediborg's hypospray produces Doctor's Delight instead of Tricord. CMO's hypo starts filled with Doctor's Delight. Syndicate simple animals have a higher block chance vs projectiles than they do vs melee attacks (there are just way too many guns strewn about my map for them to live long otherwise) git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4877 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 -Replaced two manual valves in atmos (above the canister ports) with easier to use pumps. This will let you easily redirect the flow of the gas. -Busses can now be connected to broadcasters. Meaning a simple setup of: Receiver -> Bus -> Processor -> Bus (same bus) -> Broadcaster. Not as fast as the current setup, but it would be nifty for emergencies. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4875 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Removed the old gateway structure placeholders. Made the gateway check for another gate before checking for whether it is charged. This is too stop poor confused players standing at the gate waiting for it to locate an away mission when one isn't loaded. Ticked stationcollision.dm so it is actually possible to play Nodraks map without specifically compiling your server to do so. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4870 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 -Walls, firelocks and glass-less airlocks now stop heat. -Fire made more deadly, as the flames will add more damage and a fire can spread more quickly. -Fire can break windows now, meaning they can potentially extinguish themselves by opening a window to space. -Increased the delay for atmos to process a cell and airgroup, will help with the lag for 50 player servers. -Minor tweaks were made. --Plasma needing a bit more before displaying its overlay. --Pressure can now damage you at 550 kPA. This was because it wasn't viable to set the pumps to over-pressurize a room and potentially kill people. --High pressure warning shows at 325. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4869 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Fixed the medkits on my map being empty. Removed several turrets from the syndicate ships, as they made them impossible to leave/killed the syndicate mobs.

 - Added a config option that allows the admin system to run off of data from the database. There is a config options in config.txt that dictates whether to use the new SQL based system or the legacy admins.txt system. If a server is set to use the new system, but a connection cannot be established to the database, it reverts to the legacy system, same applies if a query to the database returns empty. The config option defaults to use the legacy system. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4863 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Changed the way corpses get named (cause the old one isn't working). They just take the landmark name as their name.

 The icon_state of space turfs is now generated by jumbling up its x y and z coordinates. This means when space turfs get deleted the icon_state doesn't change each time and look stupid. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4844 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 -Larva grow a little faster (an extra growth per life) when on weeds or when breathing in plasma. -Observer following is cancelled when there's no client. -Made facehuggers/eggs a little smarter. They won't try to go after people with masks covering their mouths (as that kills them), however when they're thrown they will still try to attach to the person. -Improved alien stats(). You'll be able to see the max plasma and larva will see the escape shuttle. -Blessing with a fire extinguisher wasn't working because of the volume check. Removed the check. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4842 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 -Adds cherry seeds to the seed vendor -Adds some recipes for cherries and cherry jelly -Standardizes the vendor's seed count to 3 for all (though the plants that make you high starting with more seeds than everything else was a humorous commentary). -New sprites for eggplants/seeds!!! -Making ambrosia salads removes the toxin from them now. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4841 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Added Syndicate NPCs/sprites for them. They come in a few varieties, some with shields and swords, some with guns(yes they shoot). They're simple animals, but they drop a corpse landmark when they die, so you can loot them normally. A plea to admins: Dont fucking spawn these everywhere, they're meant to be used as badguys in away missions, not for you to fuck up every round by spawning 70 of them. Clowns also drop a real (lootable) body on death. Added new corpse types. Syndicates as well as several civillian jobs. Added a new area/copied a shuttle icon over into floors as part of work on my map. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4839 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 -You can now only hear from headsets when it is on your ear slot. People around you won't be able to hear your headset anymore. -The firedoor wasn't updating the freelook camera. When I looked at it I couldn't figure out why it was using it's own "rebuild" code, supposedly it only updates the air that it set in the dir variable but the current map doesn't utilize it at all (firelocks with a dir of 8 which are lined horizontalally), and you would have to have two thick wide firelocks to make it effective. I've commented it out and I'll put it back in if we have problems. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4832 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 More work on parrots! - Parrots now have a chance to use department channels when they speak, assuming they have a headset with encryption keys. Parrots can not use the common channel ';'. I seems to be more trouble than it's worth to set up and it would get annoying very fast. - The drop_item proc now works properly for player-controlled parrots - A parrot's sprite now updates when they get pulled - Fixed a bug where a player attacking a parrot would get messages intended for the parrot - Player-controlled parrot sprites now update when they move - Player-controlled parrots can now perch themselves on perch-able objects. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4831 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 -Fixed Fire Alarm timers, the issue was caused by the fact that they were no longer processing, on account of it not really being necessary. I changed it so that they only process so long as they are timing, and changed the timing to work off of world.timeofday so it won't be affected by lag (Did that for the purpose of shenanigans). Fixes Issue 987 -Added donkie's list shuffle for Space Ninjas, was trying to work on Issue 904 and saw that it didn't shuffle the candidates so I added that, though I doubt it will fix the problem. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4828 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

When hud_used is deleted, references to those objects are removed, hence they are garbage collected.

 obj/hud is now datum/hud. There was no need for it to be an object. Moved some of the static overlays such as the dither effects, druggy effect and blurry-eyes into datum/global_hud.

 Re-added the default-vote config option for voting. For every client connected more than the total votes, it will add 1 to the default vote option (No restart or the current game-mode). /obj/admins is now /datum/admins because that's what datums are for you silly people Moved var/datum/marked_datum from /obj/ to /datum/admins admin datums are persistent throughout the round. They are stored in the var/list/admins rather than the ranks. This is so admin preferences may be moved into the datum to have them persist even after Login/Logout/Disconnects. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4749 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Proper fix for the area-luminosity bug. It seems the issue was a > instead of a >=. Meaning that most pitch-black areas were not having luminosity set to 0. This fixes space being dark. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4747 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Fixes a possible problem where admins could be kicked if ghostize failed whilst they tried to Adminghostize Fixes Issue 959 - the holder's state was not being set properly. It is now all handled at login. Verbs only update if rank or state have changed. You can bypass this simply by setting holder.state = null before calling update_admins() Moved obj/admins stuff into holder.dm so the core stuff is together, pending some possible work on admin-ranks.

 -Fix for runtime errors when shuttles move. Apparently the list holds unsimulated turf, which came from the shuttle, even though the list type is for simulated turf only.

 -Changelings will start with the free powers. Meaning they don't have to buy it everytime. -Buffed paralyse sting to 20 weaken.

 Split the gateway/center into two objects, stationcenter and stationaway. The gates actually search for and detect eachother, and warp to eachother (suck it Pete) The away gate doesn't require power to make away mission mapping possible in unpowered areas like caves, the station gate requires less power than it did (for the time being, it'd be nice if people could actually use the gate. Makes no sense to make new content so hard to use. If it becomes a problem, I can up the power requirement again). Added a "calibrated" var to the away gate. If it's uncalibrated, you'll warp to the destination landmarks. Hitting the gate with a multitool with calibrate it, and any more warping to the gate will be on target. It defaults to calibrated, so remember to set it to 0 if you want people to appear somehwere other than at the gate. Updated Cheridans map with the new gate type (and made it uncalibrated) Updated the example map to use the new gate type Updated the station to use the new gate type Changed the gateway description to reflect it's unknown origin To do: Make gates able to block sending from the other gate (so you can exile people), make damaging gates so they can't send/recieve (and still do the other) possible. Give the station gateway unique sprites (for Nanotrasens own prototype gate, with appropriate description) git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4718 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Captains no longer spawns with a cigar in their mouth, instead it spawns on the desk where the captain spawns. CEs no longer spawns with a cigarette in their mouth. I did not add a cigarette to their desk because there is already a cigarette pack that spawns there. Moved some stuff in singularity/New() into its own proc that singularity/New() calls. This is so that I can override it and prevent runtimes with an away mission. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4717 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Clowns have better reaction time in response to being attacked or witnessing their fellows in combat.

 Fixes an issue where areas were set with luminosity = 1. Not sure why the hell I done that and why the hell I never noticed it. Thanks Kor. Once again, Only crates may be sold on the supply shuttle. Changed adminverb updates to be called by Login if holder.state changes. This is so we don't have to mess around with it elsewhere and we don't have to call it as often. Added some missing verbs to the clearadminverbs proc Fixed a icon reference not using the fullpath (Goddamn stop doing that) Going catatonic makes you fall down All mobs with the resting variable can now unrest (god damn what were you doing). "Lay down / Get up" was renamed to "Rest". Rest now uses src rather than usr (again, wtf) Added some ugly fatty fat hacky code to make admin-ghosted mobs appear braindead rather than catatonic Admin-ghosting (set-observe and set-play) merged into one verb named "Aghost" (short for admin ghost, same convention as asay) git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4708 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Re-added most of the one-click antag buttons back that the tensioner used to have. The Admin tab now has a 'create antagonist' button that opens a panel with a list of options. Make traitor, changeling, revolution, cult, malf AI and Wizard should all work just fine. Make Nuke ops, space ninja, aliens and deathsquad all need some work.

Hotkey-Mode: (hotkey-mode must be on) TAB = toggle hotkey-mode a = left s = down d = east w = up q = drop e = equip r = throw t = say x = swap-hand f = cycle-intents-left g = cycle-intents-right Normal-Mode: (hotkey doesn't need to be on) Ctrl+a = left Ctrl+s = down Ctrl+d = east Ctrl+w = up Ctrl+q = drop Ctrl+e = equip Ctrl+r = throw Ctrl+x = swap-hand Ctrl+f = cycle-intents-left Ctrl+g = cycle-intents-right Admin: F5 = toggle-admin-observe (WIP) F6 = player-panel-new F7 = admin-pm F8 = (WIP) Regular controls aren't affected. There's an additional option to press the TAB key to switch into a hotkey-mode. It's a toggle, so it stays on until you press it again. It switches focus between the map and input-bar for you. This mode defaults to off so you won't even notice it unless you decide to toggle it on with the TAB key. Whilst using this hotkey mode you get additional options like pressing "T" to say something. The mode switching (TAB key) is completely client-sided. http://nanotrasen.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=15&t=10024 git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4686 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Removed the obj/screen/MouseEntered and MouseExited() proc defines as they cause clients to send more data to and from the server fairly constantly and create additional overheads for little purpose. I'll do a poll on the forums to see if people still want the intent switcher changed from a toggle to a 4-quadrant switch thingy like other servers have. From the DM reference: "Don't define this unless you need it, because it generates extra communication that is otherwise avoided. Defining it on only the objects that require it reduces overhead" I've tested it and it has these overheads for all hud objects. Added stethoscopes. They are a tie. You can use them to listen for somebody's pulse. Mostly a RP-fluff item. "You place the stethoscope against her chest. You hear a healthy pulse and respiration." You need help intent and it will give different text for each body-part. I might make it more detailed later. Removing ties from a uniform will now try to place it in you hands. Stethoscopes placed in a few places around medbay. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4682 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 File restructuring: ohgodihopenothingbroke edition. All /world/ stuff that I've found is now in code/world.dm instead of being scattered throughout the code in 6-7 files. *****IMPORTANT***** This means that hub.dm is now part of world.dm.

 Moved cyborg law-syncing back into New(). New Borgs now sync with the AI with the fewest associated borgs. So, say there were 3 AIs and 6 borgs, each would get two each. Cyborg cells now default to 7500 (like the transform procs do), this is so admin-spawn borgs don't end up with 1500-charge cells with a max of 1000-charge. Default lawset is asimov rather than an empty lawset pulsing a borg's sync wire will cause it to randomly pick an AI.

 -Changes flour from an item to a container-held reagent. All recipes have been updated to use 5 units of reagent flour for every item required previously. This has a few advantages: The 16(!) sacks of flour previously in the kitchen cabinet have been condensed to an equivalent 3 sacks. Beer is now brewable with universal enzyme, and converting lots of wheat into flour should be less tedious. Also, flour grenades, etc. Because of this, flour is now obtained from the all-in-one blender rather than the processor, and spaghetti noodles are made with 5 units of flour in the microwave. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4637 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

Lighting initialization no longer 'interrupts' the master_controller setup(). Added updated powernet debugging tools. They're in my WIP folder. They are sexy c: It draws the powernet onto the map so you can see what's going on during debugging. Added tachyon-doppler arrays. They're gonna be something for scientists to measure their bombs with rather than praying for the figures. Nothing spectacular. Commented out switches, they aren't used and I've been fixing/testing powernets all day. Sorry. If you need them back just PM me and I'll fix them. Known issues: the merging procs behave silly at intersections. I really tried to fix it but I think I'll make more progress just working on some powernet improvements. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4623 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 -Made motion cameras use HasProximity if they aren't area based motion cameras. This will allow people to set up motion cameras that will set off, without having to be in an "AI Monitored" area, such as EVA. -Removed cameras from all bots. I'll change this if there's an outcry but my reasoning is that the bot's cameras don't work well with freelook, removing it would save a lot of trouble and would help out in certain rounds. I also doubt people even care about viewing the bot's view, I sometimes forget it's a thing. -Make the AI's cancel camera view the same verb as AI Core. I did this because people were getting really confused on how to return to their core view, and the verb was basically useless since people just stopped tracking by moving a tile in a random direction. -Removed a floating camera in Engineering. -Removed a camera in the AI Chamber (front of the AI) and I made the camera an "All" camera.

 Committing the parrot stuff I have so far. It is still a work in progress and I've made sure it's not possible to spawn them yet. So far they walk around, find a perch and sleep on it... They don't copy speech yet but they do look around for items to steal to add to their collection! So basically I have made a magpie so far... The parrot bits will come later I swear. They currently use the baby chick sprite but there's a much better sprite already in the works thanks to Pewter.

 New item "camera assembly" that is dispensed from the autolathe. (700 Metal/300 Glass), deleted old grenade camera assembly. It will construct a camera after doing the following steps: Wrench it to attach it to a wall Weld it to the wall with a welding tool (Welding Helmet Required) Attach wires to the camera Possible extra steps in order to create special cameras (X-Ray, EMP Proof, Motion) (You can have more than 1 special attachment, meaning it can be possible to have an EMP Proof, Motion, X-Ray camera) X-Ray will need carrots (something for botanists) (this will possibly changed, well it will definitely carrots are weird) EMP Proof will need solid plasma. Motion will need a prox sensor. Screwdriver the panel closed to complete the camera. To deconstruct the camera, it would be not so difficult to disable but it will take a while to completely remove it: Screwdriver the panel open Cut all the wires, cutting the alarm wire is optional. Weld it. It is now a camera assembly again. Gave the cameras wires to cut/mend/pulse. Random wires for every camera to make hacking it harder. Focus wire. Will make the camera have a shorter or normal vision range. Power wire. Will disable the camera. Pulsing will make it kick anyone who is viewing it through a security computer. Will give a tiny shock if not protected. Light wire. Will disable the "Toggle Camera Light" that the AI has. Pulsing it will disable/enable it. Alarm wire. Will warn the AI that a camera's alarm has been set off, when this wire has been cut/pulsed. Does nothing else. Should only triggered once, meaning.. setting off the camera won't set it off ever again.. Special wire. Will toggle the special attachment of the camera. Pulse toggles, cutting disables, mending enables. Nothing wire. Does nothing, just here to add more wires and make guessing which wire does which harder. x 3 Placed extra cameras, I can't recall all the places but here are some.

 Preparations for reducing the number of processing machines at round-start. There are currently 8000 or so at round start, this was already pruned to 2800ish by doohl's stuff. machine.process() now uses a return value to remove itself from the processing machines list. This is more efficient and will help reduce costs especially at round start where some 5000+ machines were removed from the list using first-find. Now there is no searching involved. Instead of machines.Remove(src) just do .=PROCESS_KILL that will return the flag to the proc which called it (the MC) and trigger its removal from the list. If you're deleting something don't even bother removing it from the machines list, there is no need to. Simplified the last_processed stuff for the MC. It's now a single variable rather than 3. It is simply a typepath rather than a reference to an object (this is so it works even if said object is deleted) MC stats in admin status_panels now show the length of the processing lists (indicated by #). I've just realised I forgot to mention what the abbreviations are: The less obvious ones are: Dis=diseases; Net=pipes; Pnet=powernets; Mch=Machines; Tick=the game-mode ticker. Beach-water now uses an overlay image rather than a separate object. Fixed a typo in the shuttle console. Hydroponics trays no longer use first-find within their process() for checking the plant is in the tray (why is that even there anyway? talk about lazy) Removed some junk/placeholder procs like organ/proc/process() return Removed newscasters from the processing machines lists. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4603 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Fixes an issue with smoke bombs calling the smoke effect set_up improperly Supply_packs ow use paths rather than strings.

A number of items that were meant to spawn in supply crates that were affected by this now spawn again. (stuff like grenades, spray bottles, etc) Added a damp rag to the janitorial closet.

 Fixed a bug where throwing an emp grenade at the AI would cause the thrower to call the shuttle. - 'usr' was used in place of 'src' which caused problems since the AI's emp_act() can call ai_call_shuttle(). Added comments to mob/attackby and changed a magic number into the #define we have set for it. Simple animals must now be manually added to a proc before admins can animalize players into them. Hopefully this will encourage coders who make new simple animals to test them being player-controlled before they allow them to become admin-spawnable. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4594 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Replaced the master_controller with the WIP sequential version. Fixed a problem where TG was using this sequential master_controller but I had removed a spawn where master_controller.process() was called because I was working with the default master_controller. This problem was causing the master_controller to prevent the lighting_controller.process() ever running properly because it was hogging the current thread (thread isn't the right word there, not sure what you call it....stack?) Added debugging to both the lighting_controller and master_controller. http://filesmelt.com/dl/debugging.png Both lighting_controller and master_controller may be deleted to terminate their processes (this is done via the restart controller verb. This allows for clean restarts without 'doubling up' (where, for instance, the master_controller would be running more than one instance). lighting_controller has a prototype recovery proc which is called by the "restart controller - lighting" verb. It's basically an overly paranoid version of process() which will only transfer light_sources to the replacement controller if they don't runtime. It's not needed at the moment as the process() has yet to runtime. master_controller has the beginnings of self pruning lists. This method using list.Cut(index,index+1) is faster than doing list.Remove(thing) all over the place (the latter iterates through the list to find the thing). Added more detailed time-measurements for the master_controller. It now displays the processing costs (in real-world seconds) of each part of the master_controller's cycle. The stat panel only updates for mobs actually -looking- at the stat panel. Explosion debugging is now hidden behind a if(Debug2). To have it print that data to world.log just click the DebugGame verb debug controller and restart controller verbs are now both GameAdmin rank. Not sure how they got split up. Fixed another cause of dark splotchy space turfs. (turf/wall/ex_act was replacing the turf with space and then deleting that new space turf) git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4593 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Added movement speed config options. Basically these numbers get added directly to movement values. run_delay and walk_delay affect all mob's walk/run speeds before their mob-specific modifiers take effect. Make this number higher to slow things down, make it lower to speed things up. human_delay, robot_delay, monkey_delay, alien_delay, metroid_delay and animal_delay will affect those mobs specifically. So if you'd like humans to slow down but you don't want robots to suffer, just raise the value of human_delay! Same as before, raise the number to slow things down, lower it to speed it up. Note: most mobs already run as fast as byond will let them. Although these are config options. It is possible to adjust these values in-game. The values will reset at the end of the round however. To adjust the values in-game you must be a high enough level admin to have access to the 'Debug' tab. Open the Debug tab and select 'Debug Controller". In the popup list, select "Configuration". The variables will have the same name as those in the config options.

 -The weaken in the choke code wasn't enough and people were able to escape from being choked. I've upped it and tested it, you should not be able to escape from a lethal choke on your own any more. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4574 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 -Made wizard require at least 20 players, instead of any. This is hopefully stop a low pop wizard from killing the whole crew and not calling the shuttle until an admin intervenes. -Made nuke ops require at least 20 players. I did this because 15 wasn't low enough and it is a 5 heavily manned organized team vs 10 crew members who are just going along their own business. -Made the spells only target living mobs. This was because the spells were listing the AI eye as a target. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4573 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 -Fixed an issue where you couldn't send messages to people inside lockers. -AI has to double click to move by turf. -If more than a certain number of alarms are triggered, the AI and Cyborg will instead receive a message saying how many alarms have been triggered and of which type, they will then get a link to the "view alarms" proc. This also counts for cleared alarms. -Fixed an issue with creating turfs and it not showing up on the camera. -Modified the "Communication Blackout" event. It will now notify the AI that comms are down, if it is var/silent. Increased the EMP duration for telecomm machines. -Updated the changelog. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4572 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 The yield mode on the somatoray gun now uses a diminishing-returns formula to determine the chance of increasing yield (instead of a hard cap at 2)! Cleaned up somatoray code a bit too. Doctor's Delight, the miracle drug, now requires tricordrazine to brew. Fixes Issue 858. The text is now gender sensitive. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4571 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Added freelook AI Eye acceleration. Your AI Eye will get faster the longer you move it, allowing you to move around the station quickly. Stopping long enough will return the camera to normal speed. With this I added a toggle to the acceleration. Using it will stop the AI Eye from gaining speed. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4570 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Committing this before I forget about it again, just a change to lasertag gun icons so they actually indicates their charge git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4569 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Fixed up cryo.dm a little bit. Cryo tubes are one 32x64 sprite now. Moved some of the sprites into cryogenics.dmi- Cryogenic2.dmi is full of random shit, someone should probably look at it. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4567 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Admins now have an 'Animalize' button on mob player panels. This allows an admin to turn a mob into any simple_animal they wish. Unfortunately I had to disallow certain animal types until they can be fixed. - Mice: I know, it sucks. Mice were the reason I started making this button to begin with, and it's something that both players and admins are requesting. The problem is that when a mob is turned into a mouse, for some reason it becomes impossible to pull up their player panel. If that gets fixed, I'll allow this button to turn players into mice. - Space Bears: The bear's AI does not seem to turn off when it is player controlled. Basically the bear will automatically maul nearby players to death and spam emotes regardless of the player's actions or inaction. - Parrots: They are unfinished. They have no sprite, no movement and are completely untested. They were one of Poly's creations that never ended up getting finished. I like the idea of parrots though, someone should work on them! - Space Worms: Another unfinished project. Currently they drop new space worms when the player moves and you can end up eating your own tail. Eating your tail drops a new space worm and regenerates your tail. I only spent about 15 seconds as a space worm, so there are probably more issues. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4557 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 File structure again. This cleans up all of the files in code/game/objects/items/weapons. Meaning that the re-organizing part of this endeavour is complete.

 Changed the AI's intercoms around a bit. West = Custom Channel (mic off, speaker off) North = Common Channel (mic on, speaker on) East = Private Channel (mic off, speaker on) //No change The old system had two intercoms on the common channel, one with the mic on/speaker off and one with the mic off/speaker on. Apparently it was too confusing for players to figure out that when they changed the freq for one, they'd have to change the speaker/mic of the other. Fixes issue 837.

 Meteor guns! It's a gun that fires meteors! Admin spawn only. They do not shoot 'real' meteors, they shoot a projectile that acts like meteors. Note: The meteor projectile calls 'meteorhit()' which some objects and turfs do not have, so some things won't really be affected by them. The gun itself has a potato battery, meaning it starts with a charge of 100 and has a maximum charge of 300. It costs 100 to fire and recharges 100 every 5 ticks. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4538 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 New lighting, it's essentially just the old DAL system with a queue. Comments for lighting: Like sd_DAL (what we used to use), it changes the shading overlays of areas by splitting each type of area into sub-areas by using the var/tag variable and moving turfs into the contents list of the correct sub-area. Unlike sd_DAL however it uses a queueing system. Everytime we call a change to opacity or luminosity (through SetOpacity() or SetLuminosity()) we are simply updating variables and scheduling certain lights/turfs for an update. Actual updates are handled periodically by the lighting_controller. This carries additional overheads, however it means that each thing is changed only once per lighting_controller.processing_interval ticks. Allowing for greater control over how much priority we'd like lighting updates to have. It also makes it possible for us to simply delay updates by setting lighting_controller.processing = 0 at say, the start of a large explosion, waiting for it to finish, and then turning it back on with lighting_controller.processing = 1. Unlike our old system there is a hardcoded maximum luminosity. This is to discourage coders using large luminosity values for dynamic lighting, as the cost of lighting grows rapidly at large luminosity levels (especially when changing opacity at runtime) Also, in order for the queueing system to work, each light remembers the effect it casts on each turf. This is going to have larger memory requirements than our previous system but hopefully it's worth the hassle for the greater control we gain. Besides, there are far far worse uses of needless lists in the game, it'd be worth pruning some of them to offset costs. Known Issues/TODO: admin-spawned turfs will have broken lumcounts. Not willing to fix it at this moment mob luminosity will be lower than expected when one of multiple light sources is dropped after exceeding the maximum luminosity Shuttles still do not have support for dynamic lighting (I hope to fix this at some point) No directional lighting support. Fairly easy to add this and the code is ready. When opening airlocks etc, lighting does not always update to account for the change in opacity. Explosions now cause lighting to cease processing temporarily. Moved controller datums to the code/controllers directory. I plan on standardising them. "Master","Ticker","Lighting","Air","Jobs","Sun","Radio","Supply Shuttle","Emergency Shuttle","Configuration","pAI" controller datums can be accessed via the debug controller verb (used to be the debug master controller verb) Supply shuttle now uses a controller datum. Shuttles tend to arrive up to 30 seconds late, this is not a bug. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4537 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

Meaning if you're in maintenance, and there's no cameras near you, the AI will not know what you are doing. This also means there's no X-Ray vision cameras anymore.

More information here: http://nanotrasen.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=9675 -I've added some cameras to rooms that should have cameras but were previously depending on other camera's using their X-Ray vision in order to see into a room. -AIs have a multitool in their contents that they can use to interact with the telecommunication machines. -Added "Follow" for observers. Works the same as AI tracking without checking if they can track. -Added a range to how far Cyborgs can interact with machines. This is to stop Cyborgs from interacting with machines through cameras, which could be used to easily disable the AI. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4531 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 I wanted to wait until after the feature freeze to commit this but there have been problems with Telecomms recently and this update that I've been keeping fixes most of the issues. I've tried to remove most features from it but there were some things that I couldn't. -TCommsat machines no longer use their Z level to check if they can receive the signal or not. Instead, they use listening_level. It defaults to 0 for machines that don't change the value. If it is 0 when the telecomms machine's New() is called it will set itself to it's Z level. -This allows you to manually change the value to other Z levels. I call this an off-site relay. I've added an off-site relay on the satelitte for the station and removed the one in the communications room. -Players can create an offsite relay with two receivers, two broadcasters and, if necessary, a relay. Why two receivers and broadcasters? Otherwise any player can go to the Ruskie/Mining relays and turn them into off-site relays for the station! It would harm the TCommsat's usefulness. Instead, you will have to setup another broadcaster and receiver if you want to do that. Though it may be pointless, if someone sabotages the Commsat they would have destroyed/depowered the other machines there too. -About the option to have an offsite relay, there is only a single Z level that you can lock onto at the moment and that's the station. Gameplay wise, the TCommsat is orbiting the station and if we do get the away missions then it would not make sense for the TCommsat's broadcaster/receiver signal to be able to pickup there. More sense if the Receivers and Broadcasters from there are sent here... maybe. I don't know, seems more fun this way. -Fixed an issue that doesn't let the Engineer Borg (or Borgs with multitools) be able to link machines with their multitool module. -All-In-Ones do not have a Z level restriction. They can pick up ALL signals and send ALL signals (to Z levels 1-10) -Fixed an issue with the player being unable to remove frequencies from the filter. -Added support for additional interaction options for certain machines. To use it, create a new Options_Menu() and Options_Topic(href, href_list) for your machine. -Added EMP_ACT to Telecommunication Machines. I've also added an event called "telecommunications_blackout()", it will loop through all telecomm machines, in telecomms_list, and EMP_ACT them. The EMP will last 2 minutes. Currently only admins can use it. -Fixed issue 831 -Changed the map. The station no longer has the station relay, it is now on the Satellite. There's an empty room now, it should be used for something after the feature freeze. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4522 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Another small chunk of reorganizing objects. I've cleared out most of the .dm files in code/game/objects/ and put it into appropriate files/folders. The stuff I've left is stuff I believe may conflict with carn's work and some code for stuff that does not have a home yet. TODO: - Files that were left in code/game/objects that may conflict with carns work - Go through all the files in all the subfolders of code/game/objects. - Move all the defines from /defines/ to their proper spots Not much right? git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4520 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 First part of a fix for issue 818. Removed some pointless, unused objects.

 Changes to the file structure! There are many files, folders and chunks of code in areas that make absolutely no sense and thanks to the defines being located mostly in a completely separate file, it can be damn-near impossible to find something. Before moving defines to where the rest of their code is located; I'm going to move some code around into places that actually make sense to begin with. I'll mainly be focusing on the code/game/objects folder. This commit mainly lays the groundwork for the work I'll be doing by adding in the effects, structures, decals and turfs folders. I'll slowly be moving appropriate files and code into these folders. I may end up moving machinery into 'objects' and mech stuff into its own module folder but I'll ask for some opinions on coderbus before doing that. I've also gotten rid of the /magic/ folder. I've moved the library stuff into its own folder in modules/library, the cult stuff is now in gamemode/cult with the rest of it and musician.dm is now in objects/structures since the piano is a structure apparently. I think I've got the hang of how DM and SVN handles folders and files but it's quite possible that something will break simply by svn committing it oddly. Please let me know if that's the case! Remember to clean compile. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4513 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Hardhats and Rig helmets now properly update their mob icons when toggled with the action buttons (buttons on the top-left of the screen.)

 Revolution game mode fixes: Station-heads who are monkied now count as 'dead' for round completion. - This previously applied to revheads but not station heads.

 The changeling's regenerative ability's description now states that you have to use it before you die to help prevent confusion. A proper fix for teleport data-cards. Instead of just doing player.loc = landmark.loc it now properly uses the teleporter datum. It sets a new 'one time use' variable which means that only one person or object can pass through the teleporter before it looses the coordinates. This is also in place to prevent hand-teles from opening portals to the clown planet. Players will not really notice any change except that when they insert the clown-coordinates, they must then walk through the teleporter. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4503 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 -Worked on mech fabs a bit more, replaced the has_var() proc with just the BYOND proc, since that's all it did anyways. Tweaked another part that wasn't silently discarding junk correctly.

 - Removed the changes done to space suits in r4497. They were aimed at fixing Issue 827, which had the symptoms of randomly getting hurt in space while wearing a space suit. Sieve assumed it was due to not having high temperature protection, but it was the opposite. - The problem was actually down to an ancient bug, which wrongly calculates the temperature of tiles with very little gas on them - tiles exposed to space. Space suits protect down to a temperature of 2.0K, space is 2.7K, which I assumed to be the lowest temperature anywhere. Unfortunately I forgot about this bug at the time, which can cause the gas temperature on tiles with little air to even hit negative kelvins (Nobel prize, plox). This happens relatively often, each floor tile that meets the criteria experiences this about once every 50 ticks and if you're standing on it when it happens, your cold protection will be 0%, because the temperature on the tile will be lower than 2.0K. Everything will be fine in the next tick cold-protection-wise, but your body temperature is already lowered to under the damage threshold by then. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4498 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 -Fixed space suits not being space-worthy. This was due to them not having a define for heat protection, which meant you'd roast at the slightest provocation. Made a MAX_HEAT_PROTECTION define for space helmets and space suits, so they can be changed later if needed.

I added the setter for the bomb_set variable in nuclearbomb/process(). So if at least ONE nuke is ticking it means the bomb is set. The bomb_set variable gets reset in the appropriate places now. The places are if either the safety is enabled again or if the timer is disabled. Enabling the safety now automatically stops the timer. The timer cannot be enabled without the safety being off.

 - Added a real_name variable to DNA, which gets assigned when mobs are created and when preferences are copied as well as when changelings absorb mobs. This is so I could drop the dictionary-style list from changelings, which went list(real_name = \ref[dna]).

 - In preparation of fixing issue 585, which extends far further than just the things listed there, as well as to standardize the many incarnations of satchel-type code (pill boxes, mining satchels, hydroponics satchels, etc.) I have added some functions to storage type items: New variables: var/use_to_pickup = if 1, the storage item also works like satchels, which means you can use it on something else to pick it up. var/display_contents_with_number = if 1, the items in the storage item are grouped by type with the number of items being displayed. See the screenshot. var/allow_quick_empty = if 1 on creation, it adds a verb that allows you to empty the item with one click var/allow_quick_gather = if 1 on creation, it adds a verb which allows you to switch between pick-up methods. one-per-click or all-on-tile. Same as satchels worked. use_to_pickup must be 1 for any of that to matter. var/collection_mode = 1; //0 = pick one at a time, 1 = pick all on tile New procs: /obj/item/weapon/storage/proc/can_be_inserted(obj/item/W as obj, stop_messages = 0) - Returns 0 or 1, depending on whether the item W can be inserted /obj/item/weapon/storage/proc/handle_item_insertion(obj/item/W as obj) - Inserts the item into the storage item and calls all the procs it needs to. Doesn't check whether the item can fit tho, tha'ts what can_be_inserted() is for. /obj/item/weapon/storage/proc/remove_from_storage(obj/item/W as obj, atom/new_location) - Removes item W from the storage object and sets it's loc to new_location or get_turf(src) if one is not provided. /obj/item/proc/on_exit_storage(obj/item/weapon/storage/S as obj) - Called after the object has been removed from the storage item S. The object's loc is already set to the new one. /obj/item/proc/on_enter_storage(obj/item/weapon/storage/S as obj) - Called after the object has been inserted into the storage item S. The object's loc is already set to S. I made satchels work on this new code. The rest will be added to it soon. See the screenshot.

 Fixed issue 645. I changed how uplinks worked. Instead of there being a duplicate item which would switch out when it activates, there's an item called "obj/item/device/uplink/hidden". It is a hidden uplink which you can place in any obj/item. In "hidden" is where it will generate menus, check for triggers to show the menu and etc.. No need to switch out with duplicate items or add the menu onto the PDA's notes. How to create a new uplink item in 3 easy steps! 1. All obj/item 's have a hidden_uplink var. By default it's null. Give the item one with "new(src)", it must be in it's contents. Feel free to add/remove "uses". 2. Code in the triggers. Use check_trigger for this, I recommend closing the item's menu with "usr << browse(null, "window=windowname") if it returns true. The var/value is the value that will be compared with the var/target. If they are equal it will activate the menu. 3. If you want the menu to stay until the users locks his uplink, add an active_uplink_check(mob/user as mob) in your interact/attack_hand proc. Then check if it's true, if true return. This will stop the normal menu appearing and will instead show the uplink menu. I've given the recharge station's verbs a category so they don't create their own tab. I've added a mob/proc called put_in_any_hand_if_possible. Name speaks for itself. Returns true if successful, false otherwise. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4450 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 - Who ever heard of a massive revision with no follow-up revisions hotfixing bugs... noone!

 - Yet another issue that needed fixing resulted in the entire system having to be rewritten. Fixes issue 44, Fixes issue 690. New defines in setup.dm: This revision changes the following things: - Hot is no longer defined as 'higher temperature than 310.15K' but is defined as 'higher temperature than my body temperature'. The opposite applies for cold. - Removed heat_transfer_coefficient and protective_temperature - Added heat_protection and cold_protection flag variables to obj/item, which define which areas of your body are protected from heat. - Added max_heat_protection_temperature and min_cold_protection_temperature which define up to which temperature the item protects when worn (NOTE that it only protects on the locations specified by the heat_protection flags!) and down to which temperature it protects from the cold. - REMEMBER! hot and cold were redefined to mean 'which way your body temperature should be moving based on the air around you'. - Each tick, your body now 'corrects' your body temperature towards 310.15K which is the ideal temperature. The correction is max( difference/12, 10 ), so either a twelfth of the difference between your body temperature and 310.15K, or 10K, whichever is higher. This ensures your body temperature stabilizes over time. - Most notable changes in the amount of protection you get from common items are these: Space suits now ONLY protect from cold and fire suits now ONLY protect from heat. Now what this means is obviously that firesuits will be useless in space, but also that if you find yourself in a fire with a high body temperature and you put a firesuit on, your temperature will no longer stagnate at the high temperature, due to temperature not going up nor down, but rather it will get lower. Instead it will be protected from rising, it will however gradually get lowered by your body's 'auto-correct' attempts, as described in the last point. Additionally, if you wear a fire suit and enter an area with a good temperature (for isntance 290K) and you have a high body temperature, due to just escaping from a fire, the fire suit will not make your body temperature stagnate. Because it does not protect you from cold, and cold being defined as 'colder than your body temperature', you will actually successfully cool down to the optimal temperature. - The opposite applies to space suits. They protect from cold and don't protect from heat. If you find yourself in space and your temperature drops and put on the space suit with your temperature still low, you will recover over time. If you enter an area with a good temperature, you will recover faster, since the space suit does not protect you from heat. - In short, space suits are now better at dealing with space and fire suits are better at dealing with fires. - You will NEED a fire helmet to be protected from heat and you will NEED a space suit helmet to be protected from cold. There is no 'but'. Fire helmets are red or white hardhats, found in all fire closets. - The 'heat up' coefficients are defined in setup.dm, they are: - - head = 30% - - lower and upper torso = 15% each = 30% - - legs and arms = 7.5% each = 30% - - feet and hands = 2.5% each = 10% - Gloves cover hands - Shoes cover feet - Space-worthy jumpsuits cover legs, arms, upper and lower torso - Space suits cover legs, arms, hands, feet, upper and lower torso - Headgear covers heads - Removed the HEADSPACE and SUITSPACE flags, due to being moved to the new variables. This frees up the flag value 4. . The amount of damage heated gas and heated areas do can now be set in human/life.dm. The values are: (The different levels are based on breath temperature or body temperature.) #define HEAT_DAMAGE_LEVEL_1 2 #define HEAT_DAMAGE_LEVEL_2 4 #define HEAT_DAMAGE_LEVEL_3 8 #define COLD_DAMAGE_LEVEL_1 1 #define COLD_DAMAGE_LEVEL_2 2 #define COLD_DAMAGE_LEVEL_3 4 //Note that gas heat damage is only applied once every FOUR ticks. #define HEAT_GAS_DAMAGE_LEVEL_1 2 #define HEAT_GAS_DAMAGE_LEVEL_2 4 #define HEAT_GAS_DAMAGE_LEVEL_3 8 #define COLD_GAS_DAMAGE_LEVEL_1 1 #define COLD_GAS_DAMAGE_LEVEL_2 2 #define COLD_GAS_DAMAGE_LEVEL_3 4 The speed at which your body temperature raises or falls can be altered with the following defines: #define BODYTEMP_AUTORECOVERY_DIVISOR 12 #define BODYTEMP_AUTORECOVERY_MINIMUM 10 #define BODYTEMP_COLD_DIVISOR 6 #define BODYTEMP_HEAT_DIVISOR 6 The divisors determins by how big a difference between your body temperature and the surrounding air (or 310.15 in the case of autorecovery) will your body temperature change. The autorecovery_minimum means what the minimum recovery is, if difference / 12 is less than 10, it will recover by 10. Was all this needed to fix Issue 44? Yes..... yes... it was... Some things are consequences of decisions made while fixing it, but all of it was necessary to completely fix the issue. I found it did not remain on the tracker for this long for nothing. I'm sorry for the essay, but there was a lot of work involved and a lot of changes happened, so I had to write a lot... git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4428 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 I started with the desire to fix issue 634. It sounded like a simple issue, right? Well one complete rewrite of how equipping and stripping works later, this commit fixes issue 645 Code-wide changes: /mob -level procs: equip_if_possible() is now known as equip_to_slot_or_del() to prevent confusion with equip_to_slot_if_possible() and to better describe what it does. equip_to_slot_if_possible(item, slot, del_on_fail, disable_warning, redraw_mob) equip_to_appropriate_slot() is now a /mob - level proc. equip_to_slot() is an unsafe proc, which just handles the final step of actually getting an item onto the mob. It has no checks of whether it can or can't do that. Use equip_to_slot_if_possible() for that purpose. New /obj/item -level proc: /obj/item/proc/mob_can_equip(M as mob, slot, disable_warning = 0) This proc can be used to determine whehter a mob can pick up an item from the item's side. Carn, I'll need you to review code/modules/mob/living/carbon/human/inventory.dm to ensure that I'm not redrawing the mob too many times. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4423 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Meteors and Space dust (now that they work again) will no longer have an effect on singularity containment. Field generators and Emitters are protected. I added a check to meteor and space dust Bump() directly because changing ex_act() on the machines themselves would make the machines immune to bombs and C4. Hopefully fixes issue 716. light/process() was added back in causing lights to use power as they were meant to. Recently lights have been made brighter causing more power to be drained. As a result the engineering APC would not last very long. The station using a lot of power is a good thing since the singularity produces an incredible amount of power, so to keep this higher power demand but still give engineers a fighting chance to set up the singularity, I've bumped up the engineering APC's starting battery power. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4401 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Resolves Issue 734 > A clown's medical, crew, and security records are updated with his newname. (read below for details) > reject_bad_name() now checks for dumb names like "space","floor","wall","r-wall","monkey","unknown","inactive ai" (if you know any other important ones let me know) > clname() [clown-name] and ainame() [AI name], procs which allow those players to rename themselves, were merged into /mob/proc/rename_self(var/role, var/allow_numbers=0) This proc gives the mob 3 chances to name itself. It checks names using reject_bad_name() (the same thing that checks the round-start names). If it fails 3 times it will not change the name. If it succeeds it will call the proc in the next bullet point. > /mob/proc/fully_replace_character_name(var/oldname,var/newname) will replace most references to a mob's oldname and replace it with newname. It updates name, real_name, mind.name, updates their id, updates their pda and updates all their data_core records (manifest records like medical, security, general, locked) > data_core procs merged because they were massive and all identical. > accidentally fixed an AI sound which accidentally played upon login. It conflicted with the "Welcome to the station crew" announcement. So I commented that out to try the 'new' fixed one. If people hate it I'll comment it back to how it was. > naming a mob with the big name at the top of viewvars will use fully_replace_character_name() > Removed an uneccessary regenerate_icons() proc from every player which spawns.

 -Cleaned up sacrificing again so it didn't rely on hasvar() -Made a variation of hasvar(), creatively named has_var(), intended for objects versus datums, and the var name is case sensitive -Clean up mech fabricator code considerably, the terrible switches are all gone, and I was able to make it more robust at the same time. Now, if a junk item is added to the mech fab then it will remove it in 1 of 2 places, either when you call for the queue to be displayed (Will throw it out then rebuild the queue) or when it is processing the queue (Will throw it out then reprocess the building), so now you won't even see the shit that finds its way in there. -Made the add_part_to_set() useful, now instead of dumping everything in the "Exosuit Equipment" category, it checks if the design's category matches one of the part sets, then adds it to said set if it does (All others get dumped into "Misc"). Right now there isn't much through, mostly just moving MMIs, cells, etc... to the "Misc" set, but this would be easy to use with any other system that handles designs -Little bit of OCD here, but I noticed that the cells on the map were all 'crap' cells, even though they had 1.5x the charge of a high-capacity cell, so I changed them all to high-capacity cells with the added capacity git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4395 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Fixed issue 775. Fixed issue 767. The fix for issue 767 was to standardise spray bottle code (to some extent). If any issues come up with spray bottles, pepper spray, or chem sprayers, report them to me. Cyborgs now recharge their pacid and lube, as the size of their bottles was quartered. Changed the flash item_state to "flashbang", as it looks exactly like a flash. There's some more grammar and text clean up too, mostly with crates and closets. Finally, fixed some pipes in virology, and changed the librarian's den so the bookcases are at the top. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4394 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 -Cleaned up the code to sacrifice borgs, AIs, and brains. (Also made it possible to sacrifice AIs on intelliCards) -Gave brains a proper gib() so they are actually gone -Added a proc to the 'Secrets' panel, a variation of power the station that instead is MUCH faster and just powers all SMES, turns on output, and sets it to max (helpful for testing and it doesn't leave the server frozen for 60 seconds to process) -Added maxHealth to mice, killer tomatos, and walking mushrooms (They started with 5 health but could be 'healed' up to 20) -Made the updatehealth() actually usable outside of humans by making it use maxHealth instead of just '100' -Fix for shield generator sprites not updating properly, caused by not all generators actually updating on powerloss, and adding an update_icon() where needed Fixes Issue 751 git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4393 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Fixed issue 777. Fixed issue 439. Relating to the 439 fix, added a new define, TEMPERATURE_DAMAGE_COEFFICIENT.

 Reorganized clothing as a whole. Everything related to clothing should now be defined in modules/clothing. I'm almost certain there's clothing code hidden elsewhere but this should be the vast majority of it finished. Everything is set up related to the object types themselves (meaning paths.) So all hats will be in modules/clothing/head, all gloves will be in modules/clothing/gloves, ect... I've removed 'modules/clothing/random.dm' and 'objects/items/clothing.dm' which both seemed to just be a place where people would put stuff they were too lazy to find a proper home for. I've also moved files that had no, or very few blocks of code into more catagorized areas. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4388 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 - Addressed the issue of AIs not being able to see anything in the dark. They now have a 'toggle camera light' verb in the AI verbs panel. What this does is enable a light on the camera they are viewing from. Only the light on the camera they're viewing from will continue to be enabled. The fluff behind this change is that a loss of power in an area prevents the use of advanced camera features, such as XRAY. The amount of power which the camera network supplies is only enough to operate a light on the camera. Since there are lots of ways to remove an AI from a camera, it is possible that some bugs will appear. I tested what I could and fixed all the errors that I noticed. If any additional errors appear, please let me know. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4387 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Cleaned up the wizards spellbook, it no longer has the option of using client verb spells instead of object based ones. Object based spells are superior in every way and are the ones currently tracked by Erro, the client verbs weren't even supported anymore so there was really no reason for a ton of if statements everywhere/code for three different spellbook types (including one that used telecrystals).

 Moves mob/var/datum/changeling/changeling to datum/mind/var/datum/changeling (changeling datums are now held by minds rather than mobs) As such, changelings can now be reported at round-end, even after gibbing. Resolves Issue 251 Changeling power proc_holders are now datums rather than objects. Condensed all those changeling stings down a bit. This will make fixing issue 351 easier to fix Replaced changeling fakedeath and a number of checks for the zombiepowder reagent with a bitflag: mob/var/status_flags & FAKEDEATH setting the FAKEDEATH flag will make the mob appear dead in exactly the same way changeling parasting and parapens worked. I've updated changelings and zombiepowder to work with this flag. Bug fixes for the staff of change. There was a type mismatch and I typo'd "alien" as "xeno" so xenos were not being randomly picked. TODO: changeling purchased verbs could probably be moved to mind/special_verbs. Likewise, other modular antag proc-holders can be merged with the changeling system using the same type of datum.

 Removed the tensioner. It was buggy and really only served to ruin rounds. The original purpose of the tensioner before Poly reworked it was to act as a stat tracker, which is now meaningless since erro has a fully operational stat tracker in place.

 Added recursive_mob_check() proc. It will recursively loop through an atom's contents and check for mobs, then it will loop through every atom in that atom's contents. It will keep doing this until it checks every content possible. This will fix any problems with mobs, that are inside objects, being unable to hear people due to being in a box within a bag. I then changed the get_mobs_in_view() to use this proc for gathering mobs and radios. The old system would loop through lists for a total of 5000 per function call, in an empty server. This new system will loop at around 1000 in an empty server.

 Minds part 3 Removed mob/var/original_name. Totally replaced by datum/mind/var/name now. Fixed round-end reports. They're now sort of follow the same format as each-other. Not sure how the ew format will work out on high-pop servers. if it's too spammy I'll tone it down a bit. Fixed pais. Their life.dm got unticked. Resolves issue 759 Known issues: Borgs keep their human objectives when borged. I'll try playing with the way minds work for silicon mobs whe the freeze is over. No way to edit minds when they are not attached to a mob. Need some sort of debugging tool. datum/mind/var/mob/living/original isn't realy used for much. I could probably replace it with something more useful. Changeling stuff is messy. The changeling object should be referenced by the mind not the mob (or something) Part 4 on hold will try to address some of these known issues. Taking a break from minds to fix some issues on the tracker now (like lighting) git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4355 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Important! Minds part2 - Carn loses her mind. The way datum/mind stuff works has been changed a lot. I really can't explain everything. If you have any questions it'd just be easier if you leave a comment or ask me in coderbus. Generally, minds now represent IC characters rather than following a client around constantly. Minds can change owners, mobs, (names WIP). Technical babble: The var/current and var/original variables of the mind datum must always be of type mob/living (or null). Please do not mind.transfer_to(ghost_mob). If you want to ghost somebody use ghostize()! It will do all the technical stuff for you. mob/dead/observer/var/corpse was removed. mob/dead/observer/var/mind is now used as a reference to the last mind the player had (so respawning code has something to reference), but also because mind.current is a far more useful way of tracking a corpse. If somebody triggers a mind.transfer_to() call on your corpse, your mind will be tranfered to another mob/living or something...that will then be considered your corpse. This could allow for more interesting mind_transfers. For instance, the "raise corpse" rune ghostizes any player in the corpse to be raised and selectes a random dead player to take possesion of their character! The person possesing them will have all of their memories, objectives, etc. The poor guy who was originally the owner cannot re-enter body if there is another player in his body...but if that player is ghosted he can once again return. Exorcisms anybody? Changes to cloning and hydroponics. I will likely have to rework these later as they're hacky as hell right now. A lot of stuff is now handled by Login/Logout rather than in hundreds of different places. One such example, mind datums get their variables updated at Login and Logout. Fixed a few minor bugs. I'll update the issues manually in a bit because I literally cannot think atm. TL;DR guide: -If you want to make somebody a ghost use ghostize(). Or you will need to find a doctor to stitch your bits back on. :) -You don't have to worry about making minds. Simply doing key="carnwennan" or whatever will either: A) make a new mind and initialise it if there isn't one or B) take possession of the mind currently attached to the mob. -It's safe to transfer a mind even if a key isn't in-body (e.g. they are ghosted/admin-observing etc!) Minds have an active variable which tracks whether they are currently synced with a key. This is to avoid dragging ghosts back into their bodies when say, a wizard mind_transfers them. -Transferring a mind whilst var/active=1 will cause the following: mob.key = mind.key. So no need to do that separately (in fact you'll lag things if you do, so don't) -If you do want to initialize a mind manually, say if you don't have a client to login to the mob yet, simply do new_mob.mind_initialize(). Simple! When someody is logged into that mob they will take ownership of the mind and it will sync up. NOTE: a lot is probably broken since this is a pretty massive change. Please let me know asap (with actual info! Shouting at me, "IT BORKED HALP", doesn't help) git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4342 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Cleanup of proc/helpers.dm Split a bunch of procs in helpers.dm into new files: -helper_list -helper_text -helper_type2type These files are sorted into groups internally. Hopefully people will make it easier for people to find useful procs. I've added comments to a good chunk of these procs as well explaining what they do. I've removed a few unused or unnecessary procs and fixed up a couple that were not working as intended. I've also moved a mob proc 'get_equipped_items()' into mob/inventory. All of the non-helper.dm files (besides mob/inventory.dm) are the result of fixing duplicate procs. It seems that there used to be text searching procs where one was case sensitive and one was not, and at some point someone removed the case-sensitivity of the case sensitive procs. I've re-added the case-sensitivity and as a result, I've had to go through extra files and ensure that they were calling the proper proc. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4341 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Ok, part 1 of this huge mind datum fix. I need to run over the next part again because I've made a lot inconsistencies in it. This is sort of all the misc stuff that got tidied up whilst I was trying to get my head around how everything related to eachother. This part focuses on: -structuring the way silicon mobs initialise upon login (there was some hideous copypasta in Login() and New() which used spawn() to change the order of the calls so it was all jumbled up. I think I've got it sorted now. -Borgs var/real_name was not initialising as "Cyborg". Meaning the name checks were kind of borked. -Ghosts are now deleted at logout if they no longer have a key. This will stop unneeded ghosts being left lying around. It will not delete ghosts with keys assigned (so people can't respawn or anything). Removed all the del(ghost_ref) stuff I could find. Generally movign the key from a ghost should be the last thing you do as the ghost will be deleted by Logout. However I've put it in a spawn() to hopefully avoid coders accisentally using it in a way which causes runtimes. -Fixed clone-plants spawning dud potato-people left, right and centre. They'll now dump seeds if it fails for whatever reason. -Cultist and Rev status are removed at mob/living/silicon/Login() rather than having to be called on a special-case basis everywhere. This may not be necessary when this stuff is finished. -Removed a bunch of : -Commented mob/living/Login() with the rest of the antag-indicator code from cloning.dm and hydroponics.dm for any coders whom feel brave/suicidal to fix the related issues Next on the agenda, replacing mob/var/original_name with datum/mind/var/name to fix the ticker runtimes Then, fixing mind/proc/transfer_to(mob) once and for all. (There are issues with duplicate minds, role updates, inconsistent initialisation etc etc *yawn* There's probably a few obscure bugs in there somewhere. Might want to hold off on the updates for a bit. Coderbus will likely spot them all by the end of the week. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4322 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 At the start of each job selection level, heads will be checked before all other jobs. What this means is that if you set something like RD and scientist both to Medium, when it comes around to the Level 2 or the Medium preference checks if RD is open you will be placed in the lottery for RD before scientist (or any other non-head job set to Medium). Unlike the change made in r4296 this one still respects player preferences. r4296 would ignore all non-head jobs for EVERY level until it found a head before it even began to run the standard selection code. With this change the older FillHeadPosition is not quite as important and could likely be removed if wanted however it does still help in cases where you would end up with no heads yet someone had a head set above never. tl;dr The idea of having a head job chosen over a normal job of the same level is good, however the way it was implemented was not due to how it ignored other preferences. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4317 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

This mostly caused issues with oxyloss, because once you hit -100 you stopped breathing, but were still alive. -You can no longer put borg items on monkies, and while I was at it I made directionals for their handcuffs Fixes Issue 728 Fixes Issue 731 Fixes Issue 714 Fixes Issue 694 git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4310 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

I just removed it, I doubt this will have an effect on anything. -Fixed 661 - There was a typo which would show toxin damage twice instead of showing oxygen damage. I also made it clearer which damage was which with colour. -Fixed 565 - I wish there was a proper way to fix this but it's better than having no door for 5 seconds. It'll now wait 2 ticks before performing the closing animation for the door. -Fixed 722 - I think this is causing the problem, it's using name instead of real_name.

 Reverting r4296. This is not a bug this is intentional you should really read the code and figure out exactly what it is doing before making changes, something I seem to be seeing quite a bit less of these days. The FillHeadPosition proc makes sure there will almost always be at least one head by grabbing a list of everyone who has the job set to high, if no one has it set to high it will check the next job until it either gets at least one player or runs out of jobs. If it has at least one player it picks a random player out of the list then terminates as we now have one head. If we ran out of jobs we now check the jobs again using the medium setting. If that does not work then we use low. After this proc has been ran you likely have one head, if wanted it could easily force a head by checking the return however that was deemed unnecessary. Next the code runs nearly the exact same code but for AI checking. After that it proceeds with the standard job selection code, the rest of the heads are in here. tl;dr It was working fine, you will end up with at least one head so long as a single player has a head set above never. Using this for all heads overrides the entire point of having a low/med/high for heads and will cause low pop servers to have a very high head to crew ratio. Also please read over and try to understand what code is doing and why before you start messing with it. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4297 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 - I attempted to group together some code in human.life() when I was doing the breathing updates. The code I wanted to group was the code that handles the situation when you are located inside another object - this code is copy-pasted into 4 places in this proc. So I started deleting them, but then abandoned the attempt. Apparently I did not press undo enough times, causing two of the code segments to be left out. This meant that only turfs now facilitated breaths, objects did so only in specific situations.

 - Changed human breath processing to work like this: - - If a breath is successful, meaning it had enough oxygen, another breath will be taken in 4 ticks. This is the same as it was before. (The presence of other gases will damage you, but it will not make the breath not count as a 'successful' one) - - If a breath is not successful, you will not wait another 4 ticks for another breath! You will try to breathe again in the next tick. Every time a breath is deemed unsuccessful, it will cause damage to you. If there is no oxygen on the tile, it will cause 3 oxyloss damage to you, if there is some oxygen, but not enough, it will do a percentage of that. The amount of damage is the same as before, but it's dealt as 3 per tick instead of 12 per four ticks. The reason for this is to make the 'slowly passing out' effects more visible, as the overlay changes for every 5 points of oxy damage. - - The healing effect of an area to oxyloss remains at 5 points per FOUR ticks, as it's only applied on successful breaths, which then don't try to breathe again for another 4 ticks. - - You still pass out at 50 oxygen damage. - The dark image overlay you have when blind or in critical condition now has mouse opacity set to 0, which means all mouse clicks pass through. If this causes any problems - let me know, it is however needed as it otherwise prevents any clicks. So while you could see a small circle around you, you wouldn't be able to interact with anything in it.

 - F12 now properly hides the action buttons - Changed the 'black overlay' you get when paralyzed, blind or in critical condition to include a small circle around you. It still 'blinks' once every 25 seconds or so. - Added a flag BLOCK_GAS_SMOKE_EFFECT, which can be applied to masks, glasses and hats, which prevent gas smoke, which contains reagents, from having an effect on you. Currently only present for gas masks. - Dramatically lowered the amount of damage you get per breath while in critical condition. Critical condition now lasts for about 5 minutes if nothing is causing you any additional harm. This in combination with the new black image overlay is an attempt at making doctors more willing to help. For one thing they'll have more time to get to you, for another you will get to see if they murder you before sending you to genetics. - Added Cheridan's wooden chairs to code - Added a action_button_name to all items, which defaults to null and contains the text which appears on the action button. If an action button exists, but this variable is not set, the text will default to 'Use [name]', name being the name of the item tied to the button. - Fixed the problem which resulted in certain glasses types making you keep night vision abilities even after you took them off.

 Added global lists for chemistry datums. chemical_reactions_list for storing /datum/chemical_reaction so we don't have to spawn them all everytime two reagents get mixed together. chemical_reagents_list, unlike reactions it is indexed by id so we can have fast lookup of reagent data. Again, without spawning everytype of that datum everytime we add a reagent to something It was making all subtypes of this datum everytime it filled any reagent_container with a single reagent. Considering how many reagent containers there are that's a lot of wastage. Now it only does this once, thank goodness. Unfortunately I had to stick the initialisation inside the datum/reagents holder object's New() proc, since New() for map ojects gets called before world/New() Fixed clean_blood() yet again *sigh*.

 Created global lists for hair and facial_hair datums since they are referenced frequently. This means those datums are only ever created once. Also, the list is indexed by hairstyle name. This means means we only need to store one variable to find the hair datum. It also means admins can change h_style and f_style to the name of the hair and use the Regenerate Icons function in viewvars to update a human's hair icon. If an incorrect f_style or h_style is input it won't affect anything adversely (besides hair not showing for that mob). The hub will no longer report admins who are stealthminning. Added a server byond_version check. All it does is tell you if your byond_version is below RECOMMENDED_VERSION and encourages you to update BYOND.

 I've made some adjustments to the Fireball spell. I've changed it to shoot in the player's facing direction instead of you having to pick a name from a list. It will explode upon contact of a person, if it hits an obstacle or if it shoots for too long. To make up for the fireball not being able to go diagonal I've shortened the cooldown to 10 seconds.

 Bit of standardization and optimization for life procs that I wasn't able to finish when I did it to humans a while ago. Basically if a mob is alive, it'll run a set of procs and if it's dead, it'll skip them.

 - Added recursive explosions to code. They are not live yet. I want coders to test them out first. From my testing and estimates, they are about twice as fast as regular explosions, despite the fact that they only have minimal optimization done to them at the moment. - Basically only the things I knew from memory. - Added two max() things to lighting code. This should stop the negative luminosity error, which happens when large explosions happen, resulting in a large blob of permanently black space.

 All radios now only work in their Z level. This means that the CommSat has a few more additions to work with this change. There is now a new Telecomms Machine called the Relay which allows information to travel across Z levels. It it then linked to a new machine called the Hub, which will receive information from the Relays and send it to the buses. Because every Z level needs these relays, which are linked up with Receivers/Broadcasters, every Z level will get one. There is one in the station, in the RD's office, one in Telecomms as always, one in the Ruskie station which is turned off and hidden from the HUB's linked list. The last one is in Mining but the location for it has not been decided yet.</li> PDAs now need to be in a Z level with a functioning Relay/Comms Network in order to send messages. It will also send uncompressed (scrambled) messages like you would with the ordinary voice messages. I've gotten rid of the "in world" check for blackboxes, when there can only be one. You can now easily send test signals to see if Telecomms is functioning for an atom. test_telecomms() git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4222 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Removes some seriously confused code regarding transferral of minds to ghosts upon death/gibbing. The main problem is: if a mind is transferred to a ghost, objectives that have that mind as a target will treat the ghost as the target mob. Which is clearly a problem. This should fix exploits where people could force people to win/lose objectives via ghosting, gibbing, etc. It should also eliminate any other weird bugs like the one Nodrak fixed a while ago where pais would keep their mind....meaning they were like, a cultist pai or something and could rat antags out to its owner using the HUD. Removed some conditions from objectives (like those pertaining to the thunderdome) as they were bait for meta. >ghost >teleport to thunderdome >antag fails the objective she completed Resolves issue 662 Fixes a few instances of original_name becomming null (there's still loads) git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4214 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 put_in_hands() now makes objects behave like they were just dropped when it dumps them on the floor due to there being no free hand to put it in.

 It is now easier to modify UI's through genetics: Instead of the subblock picking a random value far from the current value, the player can select a 'target' value to aim for and subblock will try to zero-in on that target. This affects UI's only, SE's don't do this. This will not be added to SE's because superpowers don't need to be made easier to obtain. Hitting the arrows to change blocks/subblocks will now loop around once you've hit a limit. - For example if you're on SE block 14, clicking higher will bring you back around to block 1. Commented out the scan console process() as it was just doing meaningless checks. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4204 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Tidied up on_consume() and the trash code for snacks. Trash is now the path for the trash-item prototype (the thing it will spawn when you finish eating). This removes the need for a switch.

 Mimes can no longer whisper without breaking their vows. Mimes don't talk! Lockers and crates now holy a maximum of 20 objects.

 - Added UI buttons which appear only when you have certain items on you to make toggling some stuff easier and lessen the need to juggle a million items all the time. Screenshot: (Upper left) http://www.kamletos.si/object%20ui%20action%20buttons.png There can be a maximum of 5 of these buttons shown at any one time. Currently the following items have a UI button associated with them: - Flashlights - Hardhat - RIG suits - Welding masks - Jetpacks To add more buttons, add a button icon_state to icons/mob/screen1_action.dmi, then set the variable icon_action_button to the icon state of the icon you just added. This is all you need to do if you want the default action to be taken when the button is clicked, which is attack_self(). If you don't want the default, you can redefine the ui_action_click() proc. A call of ..() will call attack_self(), so mind when you use that. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4193 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 -Added a new mushroom, the space shroom! (Original Title Do Not Steal) It has relaxing properties with a small amount of space drugs and sleeping toxin.

 Attack verbs! Instead of 'x has been attacked with y by z' it now reads 'x has been 'y.attack_verb-ed' with y by z'! Example: Monkeyman has been bashed in the head with a riot shield by Nodrak! or Monkeyman has been stabbed in the chest with an energy sword by Nodrak! - Every obj now has a list named "attack_verbs" - When declaring an object, just use attack_verb = list("verb1", "verb2") and so on to initialize the list for that specific item. - I've added a bunch of these to a ton of items already, feel free to modify or add more. Just try to stay away from gimmicky verbs (clown stuff being the exception.) clothing.dm and spawner.dm only had a single definition in each of them, so their definitins have been moved to obj.dm and their original dm files deleted. I'm not sure about spawner but clothing had all of its other definitions removed recently. radio.dm was a completely blank file, so it was removed.

 -OPTIMIZATION TIME -Almost every instance of 'for(mob in world)' has been killed. Because GODDAMN was it being run a bunch. Instead, a series of global lists have been made, and they are all handled auto-magically through New()'s, Del()'s, Login()'s, death()'s, etc... Lists are as follows: -mob_list : Contains all atom/mobs by ref -player_list : Like mob_list, but only contains mobs with clients attached -admin_list : Like player_list, but holds all mobs with clients attached and admin status -living_mob_list : Contains all mobs that ARE alive, regardless of client status -dead_mob_list : Contains all mobs that are dead, which comes down to corpses and ghosts -cable_list : A list containing every obj/structure/cable in existence Note: There is an object (/obj/item/debuglist) that you can use to check the contents of each of the lists except for cables (Since getting a message saying "a cable," x9001 isn't very helpful) These lists have been tested as much as I could on my own, and have been mostly implemented. There are still places where they could be used, but for now it's important that the core is working. If this all checks out I would really like to implement it into the MC as well, simply so it doesn't check call Life() on every mob by checking for all the ones in world every damn tick. Just testing locally I was able to notice improvements with certain aspects, like admin verbs being MUCH more responsive (They checked for every mob in the world every time they were clicked), many sources of needless lag were cut out (Like Adminwho and Who checking every single mob when clicked), and due to the cable_list powernet rebuilding is MUCH more efficient, because instead of checking for every cable in the world every time a powernet was broken (read: A cable was deleted), it runs though the pre-made list, and even with a singulo tearing all the way across the station, the powernet load was VERY small compared to pretty much everything else. If you want to know how any of this works, check global_lists.dm, there I have it rigorously commented, and it should provide an understanding of what's going on.

 Made Save Slots much more robust -Made a 'default' save slot (D), and whenever you connect it automatically selects the default slot to load from, but manually selecting a different slot will allow you to play on that one before it returns to default. -Added the ability to name your save slots with the '*'. Names can be up to 16 characters and contain letters, numbers, and basic symbols -The preview icon on the preference screen now takes into account any job you have set on high, and dresses up the icon accordingly. If assistant is set to 'yes', or AI/Cyborg are on high it will put the icon in a grey suit (So you can still customize). Solves Issue 667 as well I tested a good bit with other people's saves, so I'm pretty confident it won't bork savefiles.

 Added a very stripped-down version of player-notes I made a while ago for a ban system. It's very no-thrills as it was intended merely as storage for the various parts to reference. I've pretty much stripped everything, added a switch to obj/admins/Topic and linked to a simple browser interface from the player panels. It's just a single buffer per ckey. You can use the [+] and [-] links to add/remove notes. Clicking the ckeys will allow you to navigate between player notes. They are listed chronologically. Their main perk is also their main flaw, they are only a single buffer, which is fast and small. But it kinda means playing with the format won't update existing notes.

 -Added the Light Replacer (LR) ABOUT THE DEVICE This is a device supposedly to be used by Janitors and Janitor Cyborgs which will allow them to easily replace lights. This was mostly designed for Janitor Cyborgs since they don't have hands or a way to replace lightbulbs. HOW IT WORKS You attack a light fixture with it, if the light fixture is broken it will replace the light fixture with a working light; the broken light is then placed on the floor for the user to then pickup with a trash bag. If it's empty then it will just place a light in the fixture. HOW TO REFILL THE DEVICE It will need to be manually refilled with glass. If it's part of a robot module, it will charge when the Robot is inside a Recharge Station. EMAGGED FEATURES NOTICE: The Cyborg cannot use the emagged Light Replacer and the light's explosion was nerfed. It cannot create holes in the station anymore. I'm not sure everyone will react the emag's features so please say what your opinions are of it. When emagged it will rig every light it replaces, which will explode when the light is on. This is VERY noticable, even the device's name changes when you emag it so if anyone examines you when you're holding it in your hand, you will be discovered. It will also be very obvious who is setting all these lights off, since only Janitor Borgs and Janitors have easy access to them, and only one of them can emag their device. The explosion cannot insta-kill anyone with 30% or more health. -Changed the broken bottle item icon to "broken_beer" -Made the flavour text, for hitting yourself on the haad with a bottle, better. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4108 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Fixed evidence bags so the items inside are now visible even when the bag is inhand (the problem was that overlays += obj uses the object's layer variable rather than the default FLOAT_LAYER. So the hud was appearing over the overlays. Fixed it by using image(obj) to take a snapshot). Changed the overlays to underlays to make them look better. Fixed issue 637 where putting objects in bags which were currently in your inventory did not remove the item from your inventory. Replaced the obj variable var/see_face. It was used to determine whether something (namely masks/hats) hid your identity. Replaced with the HIDEFACE bitflag for var/flags_inv variable. Moved the var/flags_inv variable from atom/ to obj/item/ as only /obj/item/ can be in your inventory in the first place. Fixed get_visible_name() so it takes into account any item on the var/head when deciding if your face is obscured. (While I'm at it, just dump a comment here if there's anything that should hide your face which doesn't and I'll add the flag.) Removed the var/alien_egg_flag variable from mob/living/carbon/ and replaced it with the XENO_HOST bitflag for var/status_flags variable. You can now suicide whilst impregnated with a xeno (since you will chestburst even after death, that restriction is no longer necessary). Any mob/living descendent can ghost even when not dead. However, ghosting whilst not dead results in the ghost eing unable to return to it's body for the remainder of the round. (It has a warning popup) The suicide verb can only be used by humans when they can move and are not cuffed. These verbs will be totally replaced very soon with the 'fun' IC suicides I'm working on. Suicide is largely redundant given that anybody can ghost now, just didn't want to jump the gun in removing it. Known Issues: We've got var/flags_inv, var/slot_flags which could possibly be merged as they both deal with obj/items, although I'm not sure if we can fit oth into the 16-bit limit. Just something to look into. There are bitflags GLASSESCOVERSEYES, MASKCOVERSEYES, HEADCOVERSEYES, MASKCOVERSMOUTH, HEADCOVERSMOUTH in the var/flags variable which should really be merged with or moved alongside the very similar flags in var/flags_inv. Comments next to the defines suggest as much. You can borg dead/clientless brains but can't remove the brain fromt he borg once you realise it's a dud. >.< git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4072 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Save Slots! People can now have separate save slots for different character setups, with a customizable maximum of 3 slots per account. Since the preference files are now numbered and named differently I made it detect old saves, when a player loads a save file, so it can rename it. Basically, everything should be saved still. Character Setup UI change. I changed the layout of the character screen to not require scrolling. Screenshot 1: http://i.imgur.com/xPAzn.png Screenshot 2: http://i.imgur.com/iBKJ6.png I've made the limit variable in the All-In-One grinder actually do something. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4058 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 pAI Stuff pAI gets a better PDA that can actually receive messages from people. They can also instantly reply like everybody else now. Got rid of old pAI messaging code. pAI can toggle their receiver/signaller and their ringer. AI Stuff You can show the AI the notes on your PDA by holding it up to a camera. When you show up a paper/pda to the camera the AI can now click on your name to go to you, if you're near a camera. The AI's "track with camera" list was adjusted so that it is sorted by humans and then by other mobs. In short, the huge list of monkeys will be below the human master race. Made the AI's PDA name look nicer. When showing a piece of paper/your pda to a camera... people who are Unknown will not have a link; which would allow the AI to track them. Radio/Telecomms Stuff Made the" common server" and the "preset right receiver" listen for frequencies 144.1 to 148.9. This will allow people to use different frequencies to talk to eachother without bothering the common channel. It will also allow Revs and Cultists to work with each other; everything is still logged though so it still has risks. Increased the maximum frequency limit for handheld radios and intercoms. It will give you the option to just use station bounced radios on a higher frequency so that anyone with a headset can't simply tune in. All-In-One Grinder Created an All-In-One Grinder that is suppose to replace the blender, juicer and reagent grinder altogether. Meaning any department that has a juicer, blender and grinder will instead get this. It will help people be more independent from Chemistry by recycling food and plants. The All-In-One grinder can grind and juice. Grinding food that isn't part of a recipe will transfer the reagents of the food into the beaker. Juicing only works with certain foods. I've updated the UI a bit, it will now tell you what's in the beaker and I made it look nicer. Map I removed all blenders and juicers on the station and replaced them with the All-In-One grinder! Misc. Added myself to the admin.txt list. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4053 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Emergency Field Generators are now live! - Now have an emp_act - Can now be (un)locked by engineering IDs Reverted ghosts getting mob attack logs and moving the ghost verb to clients - This should fix the ghosting issues, but it's possible I've missed something.

If it can be implemented without all of these bugs, it'd defiantly be an asset - Fixes Issue 647 Removed logging from the cremator as it was causing runtimes and the cremator to lock up.

A bit more work on shield generators - Shield generators are now called "Emergency Shield Projectors" to help tell them apart from Field Generators and Shield Wall Generators - The as per Cheridan's advice, the shield bits now use the old cloaking animation as a sprite since it's much easier to click on then those tiny dissapearing stars. - They now shut off when unsecured by a wrench. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4031 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Moved last_x_used into the master_controller datum so that they will show up when using the debug_master_controller verb. Note: they're still global vars. Ghosts can once again shift+click... What the hell was I thinking? Condensed the flashbang kit's description. There is no reason it needs to chatspam a player's entire chat window full of redundant information. Fixed up shield generators (not currently in-game) - They create a shield on any space tile in range, helping to contain hull breaches - They can malfunction through damage or, of course, by being emagged. - The shields they create can be damaged and destroyed. - I'm not adding these to the map until shield generators and the shields themselves get new sprites (which are currently being worked on.) git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4028 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Pile of bugfixes Nodrak: - Bags of Holding can no longer be brought to the clown planet - Made a quick new sprite for broken telescreens - Removed the clusterbang from the HoS safe. It is currently bugged and not in presentable condition, however, someone is working on it. - Added a machine check to shift+click. Partial fixes issue 534 (see Zek's stuff for more.) I'm not really sure of a better way to fix this that wouldn't involve a whole pile of coding... - Cigarettes now evenly distribute chemicals injected into a pack of cigarettes. Partial fix for issue 548 (see Zek's stuff for more.) Commit for Zekkeit/39kk9t - The gibber now provides attack logs of who the mob gibbed, or who the mob was gibbed by. How can you tell who a mob was gibbed by when the mob gets destroyed? Well read the next enhancement! - Attack logs now transfer to the ghost of the mob who dies - You can no longer survive cold by cooling yourself down before jumping into space. Fixes issue 206. - Ghost() is now a client proc, not a mob proc. Fixes issue 442 - Fix for issue 493. - Added a range check to shift+click. Fixes issue 534. - Cigarette packs are now limited to (15*number of cigarettes) units of reagents. Fixes Issue 548. - Added organ inaccuracy to guns. This means, for example, that you wont hit the mob's chest with 100% accuracy. You may end up hitting the mob's arm, or head instead. Accuracy is directly related to distance. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4022 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Optimized radio code broadcasting code. Rather than calling a function on every single radio object which expensively collects hearers(in closets etc.), the proc will now instead build a list of radios. This list is then passed to another proc, which iterates through all clients in the world, and checks if the client's mob can hear the message. Note that I did shallow testing, but deeper issues may still be present with stuff like pAIs which I wasn't able to test on my single player server.

 Cleaning up machine process()s But first! Unrelated to process(): - Only humans and monkeys can move into sleepers. - Immovable rods no longer delete themselves if they hit a shuttle. Instead they act as if the shuttle doesn't exist. This should help cut down on rods deleting themselves before going through the station. And now back to our regularly scheduled programming... Removed process() that were doing nothing from: - Dispenser(the one that dispenses O2 and Plasma tanks) - Robotic Fabricators - Crew Monitoring computer Reworked hydroponic's process(). - Merged if statements together since most of them lacked "else if"s or were duplicate checks. - Changed a while loop into a for loop as sloppy coding or an admin var-editing could cause an infinite loop. Removed a sleep(100) { process() } from the operating table's constructor as the MC will call process() regardless. Cleaned up shieldgen.dm - Changed a while loop into an if statement. The loop was unnecessary - Moved some stuff around so it's not nearly as confusing. - Standardized the proc and variable definitions. - These are not currently in-game but they are amazing items. I'll see about sorting out their bugs and getting them in proper working order. Removed a for(var in world) from - cleanbot process() - floorbot process() Removed computer/engine/process() from robot/computer code - /obj/machinery/computer/engine does not exist in the first place... Note: These are only some of the machinery process()s. I didn't want to potentially break too much at once.

 Commit for Giacom: Breaking bottles over people's heads! - The bottle will be destroyed and a broken bottle will replace the old bottle - There is a chance for a glass shard to be created - The regents of the bottle get splashed onto the mob who got hit - This affects alcoholic bottles, not to be confused with pill bottles or chemistry bottles. - - Technically milk cartons and lime juice cartons, so they break as if they're glass.

 Changes to Syndicate Radios, which fixes Issue 595. Now if a an radio doesn't have the Syndicate encryption on it, it won't receive any messages over the Syndicate channel(If I can learn TCOMMs a bit better I'll try to make it a per-message basis) Changed 'traitor' headsets to 'syndicate' headsets to have it make a bit more sense. Syndicate encryption is tied to the keys, so anything with a Syndicate Key can hear the Syndicate Channel. Also, added 2 intercoms to the Nuke OP shuttle that are on the Syndicate frequency and have the needed encryption. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3991 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Alien larva now chestburst even after their host has died. To do this I had to make a custom process() for the alien_embryo disease. I gave up trying to get facehuggers to hug laying down mobs after a throw. Instead I just fixed the attack() proc so aliens can slap them onto people's faces. Changed the chestbursting code so larva are created even if no client is available. I will be making a verb so ghosts can posses aliens/larvae with no ckey depending on what headcoders think of the idea. I didn't think it fair that aliens should suffer because not enough ghosts have be_alien enabled at the exact moment a larvae chestbursts. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3987 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

Whomever started 'fixing' this and then just abandoned it with redundant and heavily-broken code should be ashamed :[ It was/is in a real sorry state. Resolves issue 617.

 ghosts now have stat=DEAD so certain verbs don't break. replaced canweaken and canstun variables with status_flags bitfield. Current flags are CANWEAKEN CANSTUN CANPARALYSE. Although you could add stuff like CANDAMAGE, CANBLIND, CANDEAFEN etc. to add additional flexibility to mob code and reduce on duplication. Added humans_need_surnames as a config option. If when spawning a human has only one name it will give them a random surname. I'd recommend leaving it on so that people can't name themselves "floor" "Unknown" etc. totally removed autolowercasing of names (except for first letter) due to people pestering me. inb4 everyone starts CRUISECONTROLLING. allowed a few characters like @ # etc for when the flag allow_numbers is set. So AIs can use those symbols (numbers and symbols cannot be used as the first character because of syntax. Added alium nests. They're basically beds that only aliums can use. They are made of sticky resin which aliums secure their prey too for sexytimes. Weed nodes are no longer dense. Tidied up some alium verbs so that they are more structured. This will allow me to add Alt-Click neurotoxin shooting for queens and sentinels Queens can secrete resin now to build nests/walls/membranes (doors to come!) Drones that evolve into queens when there is already a live Queen will become princesses instead so the hive can tell them how stupid they are for splitting from the will of the hive. It also gives them a number so they can be differentiated between. Credits to 39kk9t for fixing larva/death.dm, hissing which I forgot to do and some of the alium verbs.

Removed the invisibility verb for hunters. They now cloak when using stalk intent instead. :3 rawr git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3935 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 ** Mob Define Cleanup: Part 1 ** I'm currently working on moving all of the vars in mob_defines.dm and some procs in mob.dm into more fitting places. For example, ghosts and simple animals can not be cloned, so they do not need a cloneloss var. Cloneloss would be better fitting to /mob/living or even /mob/living/carbon. By moving these defines into proper children of /mob we lower the amount of resources that must be set aside every time a mob is created and we lower the amount of data that gets transfered between mobs when we combine, transfer or transform them. In theory, this should help free up some resources and combat lag. Due to how integrated some of these defines are in the rest of the code, I'm going to be committing this cleanup in small batches. Doing it this way instead of one massive commit means that bugs will be easier to locate and identify. It is also less likely to overwhelm players with bugs, and if it still does, it will make it easier for us to revert only the section that is causing problems. Smaller commits also means merging with existing code will be less of a nightmare and has less potential for merging mistakes. One of my goals in this cleanup is to add a description to every single variable in mob defines. While some of them are self explanatory, there are some there that are used in horribly obscure ways on top of having no comment to describe their use. ----------------------- Mob defines moved to living: - last_special* - bruteloss - oxyloss - toxloss - fireloss - cloneloss - brainloss - halloss - hallucination - hallucinations(list) *Note: I believe this variable is not needed, but the code it is used in (the resist verb) is cluttered and messy. That chunk of code probably use a re-write. I'll put it on my TODO list and if I survive mob_defines I'll try to get around to it but if anyone wants to do it for me, that would certainly help! ----------------------- Mob procs moved to living: - getBruteLoss() - adjustBruteLoss() - getOxyLoss() - adjustOxyLoss() - setOxyLoss() - getToxLoss() - adjustToxLoss() - setToxLoss() - getFireLoss() - adjustFireLoss() - getCloneLoss() - adjustCloneLoss() - setCloneLoss() - getHalLoss() - adjustHalLoss() - setHalLoss() - getBrainLoss() - adjustBrainLoss() - setBrainLoss Mob procs moved to carbon: getDNA() setDNA() ----------------------- Mob verbs moved to carbon: - Sleep - Lay down / Get up ----------------------- The : operator... The thing that has been killing me through this whole cleanup is people using or copy/pasting the : operator everywhere. *** Please use obj.var_or_procname. Do not use obj:var_or_procname *** Using obj:procname will not throw a compiler error if obj does not have that specific var or proc. This means that the coder making changes will NOT be informed of an error which will result in a proc failing, potentially being completely unusable and definatly causing a runtime error. With that said, I fully anticipate that most bugs (if any) caused by this mob define cleanup to be the result of : operators. I've been replacing many : operators in favour of the . operator as I've been going, most noteably I went out of my way to remove almost every : operator from the 4000+ line Chemistry-Regents.dm Exceptions: - Water: Turf and Atmos related vars. I'm not familiar with the members and methods in those class' hierarchy. - Silicate: because it's commented out and I honestly dont see it returning. - Thermite: Turf and Atmos related vars. - Corn Oil: Turf and Atmos related vars. Final note: While this may be the source of some mob-related bugs, there are two other revisions that have been committed between now and the last time either of the the two tgstation servers have been updated. These revisions both touch mob-related files. I'm not blaming these other revisions for anything, especially since one of them is mine anyway, I'm just listing them here for refrence to help quickly identify any problems. - My human/life() changes in r3925 - Carn's life() standardizations in r3933 Stuff unrelated to mob defines: - Fixed borgs and such being able to go into DNA modifiers. - Changelog updated and I added Sieve to the list of coders. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3934 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Ugh another big 'Carn broke everything' commit. Tried to standardise the (confusing as all hell) handle_regular_status_updates() procs for monkeys alien/humanoid, alien/larva, brains and humans. Removed clamp_values as per Rockdtben's request. Hopefully this should make those procs a lot easier to read and work with as well as reduce the number of calculations done every call. Admin's rejuvinate verb cures disabilities, sdisabilities and sight/hearing. Xenos can actually use their sleeping icon properly now. If I've broken anything let me know directly and I'll have it fixed/reverted within 24 hours. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3933 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Viruses no longer re-infect people who have been vaccinated or otherwise cured. Chameleon projectors no longer let you move freely in space. - I realize the way I fixed this is terrible, but the whole relaymove() proc in chameleon projectors is terrible. I was unable to rewrite it without breaking it completely so this fix will have to do. Runtime fix for facehuggers having a null target (the mob they're attacking.) git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3930 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 - Renamed the obj/hud other_update() proc to hidden_inventory_update() - Renamed the obj/hud show_otherinventory var to inventory_shown - Added the F12 hotkey which hides most of the UI except for the intent switcher, hands, health indicator, damage indicators and the other pop-in indicators on the right. The proc is called /mob/verb/button_pressed_F12(), the verb abbreviation is "F12" and it's hidden, so it won't show in the info panel. This currently only works for human mobs.

 Setting people's criminal status via SecHUDs now require the user to be alive, and to actually be wearing the HUD. Set the solar control computers to 'off' by default since you have to set them off then back on again to get them working properly anyway. Fixed a typo in glass/attackby() causing lit-glass tiles to not be created. Fixes issue 593 Moved certain procs in human/life.dm() into an if(stat != DEAD). This means that certain procs will update only if the mob is alive. Affected procs: - handle_virus_updates() - handle_changeling() - handle_mutations_and_radiation() - handle_chemicals_in_body() - handle_disabilities() - handle_random_events() - update_canmove() - - If dead, it forces mob.canmove to 0, meaning you don't get to be the walking dead. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3925 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 ugh...this was horrible. I'm really sorry if I fucked anything up, I was literally going braindead towards the end. Replaced every l_hand = and r_hand = and all that if(hand) crap to use standardised procs. This means we can use procs like Dropped() reliably as they will always be called when things are dropped. Thorough documentation to come. But generally, if you want a mob's icons to update after deleting something in the inventory...use drop_from_inventory(the_thing_you_wanna_drop) just before deleting it. If you wanna put something in a mob's hands use put_in_hands() (or one of the variants). It'll try putting it in active hand first, then inactive, then the floor. They handle layers, overlays, screenlocs calling various procs such as dropped() etc for you. Easy mob.equipped() is now mob.get_active_hand() because there was another totally unrelated proc named equipped() and stuff was confusing. Weakening was made instantaneous. Minor optimisations for human/handle_regular_status_updates(). I'll port these changes over to the other mobs next. Basically it should stop it constantly incrementing every status effect even after death. umm... bunch of overlays related fixes... I think that's everything. :/ git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3900 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 The machinery powered proc once again uses the argument. power_change() now defaults to using the machines power_channel Moved the remaining machinery power defines into the proper files Added code for a basic Antimatter Engine. It is currently made up of a control unit and several shield objects. The shield objects must have a patch through other shield objects or be directly touching the control unit. If they are unable to find one they will be del’d. The control unit needs to be given an antimatter containment jar for fuel before it will properly startup. A core is created when a shield object detects it has shields/control unit surrounding it. You can safely inject double the number of cores worth of fuel. Getting blown up, getting hit by the blob, getting hit with high force items, getting shot, being fed too much fuel will all end up lowering the stability of the reactor parts and once the stability gets to 0 it will either break or, if currently processing some fuel, explode. I’ve tested the parts several times and nothing seemed to go wrong, the sprites suck but that is to be expected. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3881 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Borgs and AI's - No longer able to be cultists because their objectives completely contradicts robotic laws. Fixes issue 510. - No longer able to be revolutionaries. - - There was existing code for this already, but it should function properly now. - - It now takes into account admin's borging players. pAI's can no longer see revolutionaries or cultists. - pAI's get a brand new mind instead of wiping their previous antag status. - This way it prevents players exploiting the cult/rev hud icons and it does not affect the end-round scores and statistics. Piano's 'repeat' has a limit of 10. - This will stop byond from thinking playsong() is an infinite loop and crashing the server. - Added a check so that players can not bypass the limit without stopping the song first. - 10 is just an arbitrary number I chose, feel free to change it but keep it within reason... and byond's limits. Fixed a bunch of 'emergancy' misspellings. - Commit log worthy material right here. Fixed a bunch of 'emergancy' misspellings. - Commit log worthy material right here.

Admins already have an impressive array of pointlessly formatted verbs such as 'announce' which should be used when a message has to be shoved in people's faces.

 Changed circledistance a bit, talk about ambiguous proc-names...it has nothing to do with circles! It's now called approx_dist and uses some magic constants to avoid those god-awful sqrts and powers which were called for N^2 turfs during explosions. It should approximate the distance between two points fairly accurately using a (surprisingly accurate) linear approximation of pythagoras theorem. C: Changed RoundExplosions to a temporary define named USE_CIRCULAR_EXPLOSIONS which is a lot more intuitive and less confusing. Removing this define will compile square explosions code instead of circular ones. (So the cost of having a choice between circular/square is seen at compile-time not at run-time) Fixed aliums being able to pick up storage objects such as bags/boxes/pillboxes and such. Fixed unbuckling yourself from beds (via clicking the bed). You can also unbuckle yourself via resisting because beds are hard to click on when you're lying on them and they're covered in a sheet. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3854 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Removed the round explosions bit from the explosion code as nonrounded explosions have not been used in quite some time. Readded the fake solars to the DJ station, the place is still simulated but it had a magical SMES anyways and did not need real solars, also removed its atmos pipes as the place does not need an atmos for how much it gets used. Several carp that spawn on Z2 have been removed, no need to have them eating up processing power over there. Yet again removed the random zvent sitting on the centcom zlevel, I swear I have removed that thing at least five times now. The Tcom sat solars are now fake, turns out half of them didn’t actually work as is and were there to look good. Also cut a shit ton of wiring out of the sat, removed most of the turrets, and merged most of the areas. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3853 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 - Coded in a debug report feature for the master controller. If the MC's delaying loop does not pass within 600 iterations (roughly 60 seconds) it means the procs are likely broken.

 - As approved by head coders this revision is a revert of DMF vending machines. The interface was restored to the html driven one from before that. The reason for the revert is the lack of a fix for the DMF-related vending machine UI bugs which include the splitting of the interfaces across the DMF screen and the browser window when hacking. The 2nd bug is the lack of a proper update to the items in the DMF list when coins are used. I also personally think the DMF UI was really, really ugly, but that's just personal taste. (The chemical dispenser continues to use the DMF interface as there is nothing broken with that) git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3833 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Quicker explosions: - This is more of a fix for the current method of explosions, not a fix to make explosions more efficient as a whole. - Explosions used circlerange() which had improperly named vars. At a glance, it looked like it was just returning turfs in range, but in reality it was returning all atoms in range. - Explosions now use circlerangeturfs() which only returns turfs circlerange() - Changed the variable names to reflect what they actually use to prevent this kind of confusion again. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3832 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 - Reduced the max amount of damage high pressure does from 20 to 7. - Added a flag called STOPSPRESSUREDMAGE. When this flag is applied to headlmets/hats it reduces the amount of pressure a mob feels by 40%, when applied to suits it reduces it by 80%. (The max it can reduce pressure is obviously 100%) These coefficients are defines in setup.dm called PRESSURE_SUIT_REDUCTION_COEFFICIENT and PRESSURE_HEAD_REDUCTION_COEFFICIENT and can be tweaked as needed. - Added a calculate_affecting_pressure(var/pressure) proc to all mobs which takes in pressure and returns the adjusted pressure which takes into account the clothes they are wearing. Currently used for monkeys (where it just returns pressure, since monkeys can't wear protective clothes) and humans, where it takes into account the stuff on the human's head and suit storage. - Somewhat standardized human and monkey life file code. - Added the pressure stuff to the changelog - Removed a provocative entry from the changelog by carn. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3829 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Added some #undef (undefines) to try speed compile times up a little bit. Added resources.dm where FILE_DIR can be defined manually. It should speed clean-compiles up by reducing the number of places the compiler searches for resource-files to put in the resource-cache (stuff in ' ' quotes. e.g. icon='human.dmi'). To use manual FILE_DIR defines go to: Build > Preferences for tgstation in dreammaker. Then un-tick "Automatically set FILE_DIR for sub-directories" It also means you have less crap to clean up in the .dme before every commit C: git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3820 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Server crashing and exploit fixes Added a cooldown to the containment field shocking players - If a containment field was set up in a small room, it was possible to crash the server by jumping into the field with no way to escape it. This was likely due to the hundreds of spark effects being generated every second, on top of all the other calls it had to make. Used the existing parent proc to check for proximity, canmove and death on: - Atmos pumps - Atmos mixers - Canisters. (This should finish off issue 397.) - Crew monitering computer (This one probably didn't need it but it shouldn't change the way it works.) Added admin checks to: - datum/mind - tensioner If either of these fail an admin check an admin log will be entered into the server logs and a message will be displayed to admins. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3818 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 WARNING: This has been thoroughly tested and I'm happy that it's -stable- (it shouldn't runtime). However, it might have a few niggly bugs caused by specific items using no-standard or weird code. Most bugs will be stuff like it not updating overlays and such and can be fixed simply by dropping the item. That being said, if you're not comfortable with this, I'd suggest waiting to update past this revision. update_clothing() has been broken up into it's key parts. A full explanation can be found in code/modules/mob/living/carbon/human/update_icons.dm the tl;dr of it is that overlay updates are no longer called by the gameticker. Instead they are called by procs such as u_equip db_cick etc. This means faster updates (although admittedly, more of them can be called per tick). This however is offset by the fact that specific overlays can be updated now, vastly improving its efficiency. This will especially help when there are large numbers of dead mobs. Fixed the throw code for TKgrab so it can be toggled. Cloaking for aliens/humans/ninjas was changed. It's very crude at the moment and for that I apologise. But it works and is very efficient.It also stops cloaked individuals becomming invincible due to people being unable to hit them (even when they know exactly where they are) Fixed a bunch of bugs with damage-overlays. They were updating FAR FAR to frequently. They were also horribly inefficient. They should now be virtually seamless when updating and only use cached icons, so they aren't affected by lag as badly. This may help with explosions lag a little. There's still a tonne of stuff I need to refine with this. I'll be refining it down into some helper procs to reduce on code duplication and such git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3811 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 - Full revert of r3803, approved by project leads. r3803: - Contained many bugs, first of which was that it didn't really... work. - Split the HUD and code into separate objects, thus creating a fork in code. This implies that any changes need to be mirrored on the fork objects, thus doubling the amount of code maintenance we have to do. - The UI should be one of the most standardized things around. Giving choices here is bad design practice. - Double the amount of defines does not equal to double the amount of fun. - The revision does not adhere to our coding standard. See the changes to /trunk/code/modules/mob/hud.dm in r3803 as an example. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3804 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

TK users no longer get shocked while bashing grilles using TK. - Range check on grille shocking. Fixes Issue 419. Added to the lighting checks for Plantmen. They should no longer starve on the shuttle. Fixes Issue 471. Bombs now affect people inside lockers. Fixes issue 208. - Modified Sieve's original change so that the contents of the locker get severity+1. Meaning a weaker severity meaning the locker offers some protection.

If a window already exists in that direction it makes it 90 degrees to your left, if one exists there too, then another 90 degrees, etc. - The resist verb and UI button can now be used to escape from welded or locked lockers. It takes the standard 2 minutes to get out of a locker. If this is a secure locker, the locker is broken in the process (same effects as if an emag was used on it).

Takes 15 lengths to make, applied the same way as handcuffs, they have the same effects as handcuffs, but only take 30s to remove if you resist.

 - Department radio keys are now a global list and no longer a list that gets created every single time 'say :X' is used - You can no longer whisper when stung by a changeling or had another thing make your 'silent' var get set. - Added a single empty toolbelt to robotics, added a wrench and screwdriver to toxins. - Power cells now always spawn full. The double use of the 'charge' variable was not good, as when creating the map it had a value of 0 - 100 to represent the percentage of the cell's power, while it was used as a numeric representation of the amper-hours that were still left in the cell. The problem this caused was that cells created mid-round (cells which spawned in closets or were spawned by admins) always started empty. They all start fully charged now. Additional obj/item/weapon/cell/X/empty types were added if we want empty cells. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3763 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Not a whole lot going on in this commit, just more work on preparation for the traitor factions update. Added some new sprites and weapons. New weapon: Delivery grenade. Can spawn an x amount of mob/object y in a constant radius. It is currently used for carp and manhack delivery grenades. !! Important !!: Certain telecomms computers were causing very nasty machine disruption through some very silly mishap involving re-programming a computer's network. Basically, it was breaking machine procs every time you messed with them. This should hopefully make telecomms a lot more stable. Fixed a bug where the reflexes nanoaug would not actually dodge the projectile if the person was clicking directly inside the target's 32x32 border. I changed around some core PDA messaging functions in preparation to PDA Chatrooms (yes Legality it's happening). However I'm going to hold off actually implementing it until Messycakes is either completed with his PDA UI overhaul or just stops working on it. Committed two patches from separate people in the forums.

Same has been done with Solars --Doors have been moved around to match the new areas. --Several windows facing into station areas have been removed. --Overall it should be darker and more winding -Added Sieve's EngiVend to engineering and reduced number of lockers -Scientists no longer start with gas masks and o2 tanks (Still available from the lockers) -Added paperwork objects to detective's office git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3752 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Sieve stuff, this is a stupidly big commit, I'm sorry, I really am. Full details in this thread: http://nanotrasen.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=8898 And a summary of the most important bits: -Door animations no longer desync and do the open-close-open thing. That's been around so long most people don't even notice -Welding tools no longer get their icons desynced -Fixed unpowered mineral door runtimes -Chemistry machines now require power to run -Fixed the proc to apply radiation based on armor, which means that you can actually not die of radiation as quickly if you wear armor that protects against radiation --By fixing this, it also fixed the singularity, so you might want to be careful next time you run by it naked --Also means that radiation events take armor into account. How great -Hopefully have a bugfix to prevent borgs from using lag to enter the game without an AI or laws, but I cannot test it myself other than that it didn't break anything -Disposal sound can only play once every couple of ticks, so no more ear-rape by disposals! -Lasertag guns can no longer be used to make lasergun turrets -Cleaned up stray pixels on several doors and the lasertag guns -Reworked how falsewalls work, now whenever you attack them with certain tools (drills, welders, etc...) it instantly turns them into a wall and pushes the attackby(), meaning you might not even notice that you just drilled down a falsewall, and at the very least they are much more fitting -Omni-directional PA console! Never have to worry about rotating that fucking computer again, because now it does it itself! -The Marisa robe that spawns in the theater no longer protects like armor -Tweaked coefficient list for fake insulated gloves (misplaced punctuation messed up the list a tad) -Moved falsewalls out of 'transfer_valve.dm' and into 'structures.dm' -Tweaked smoothwalls so it only connects walls with like minerals (only seen effect is on the new walls) --Also added appropriate signs to areas -Reworked portable turrets to be a lot less laggy, now they determine the projectile type once, then save it so they don't have to go through else if chains every time they fire -Added many sprites from WJohnston, but many are not fully implemented (Mostly floor ones) -Added a vending machine for engineering, the Engivend. Apparently it was needed because of the lack of availability of the Autolathe or whatever. -Added WJohnston's Dark Gygax sprites, then made a Death Squad Gygax out of them. A bit tougher than the standard Gygax, improved battery, and is pre-fit with gear, ideally for 'hit and run' tactics -New Odysseus construction sprites, also removed the Odysseus Carapace in favor of plasteel like the Ripley, meaning they in terms of construction, a Ripley is equivalent to an Odysseus -Added an 'is_hot()' proc, when called it returns the temperature of the item in K, while taking into account things like whether or not the item is active or whatever -Rewrote the Experimental Welding Tool, now instead of having a super-sized tank, it uses super-concentrated plasma that is turned into gas inside of it as its fuel source. Meaning, it will never have to be refilled, but it takes time for it to fill itself -Added WJ's firelight sprites and code. Wanted to use them, but haven't had a chance to really implement them, but still, they're there -Turrets made with lasertag guns now fire their respective team's bolt -The turrets also automatically target anyone on the opposing team (But will continue to shoot at anyone, for shits n' giggles) -Turrets get corresponding sprites based on team -Shooting a turret with a different team's laser will disable it for 10 seconds -You can also make ED-209's for your lasertag games/pissing off sec -These are constructed just like a regular ED, but instead of a security vest and taser, it requires a lasertag vest and gun (same colors) -When geared for lasertag, They will not arrest anyone nor melee them, only patrol (if set) and shoot -They have their color schemes as well, and can be disabled just like turrets -For both turrets and EDs, when geared for lasertag, they will not shoot anyone on the ground, this was due to very quickly learning how fucking OP that was for 1 turret to stunlock 3 people for eternity -And when they are geared for lasertag, both the turrets and EDs have their access changed to maint, clown, and mime (This will not stop any of them from being shot, however) -As a side note, you can also make lasertag stationary turrets for any map-related things -Now walls are based on a plating system, meaning all walls have a girder with a mineral plating on top of it. -As of right now, usable minerals are Silver, Gold, Diamond, Uranium, Plasma, and Sandstone (Lacking sprites for wood, *cough*) -This also carries over to falsewalls, so you can make falsewalls out of any of those minerals -Also, this carries over to powered doors, meaning you can construct useful doors out of minerals, so you could have actual diamond forts with doors requiring access to get in or whatever -All of these are standardized, and for the most part work just like regular walls, meaning if you start slicing a wall, it will drop the mineral, or if you drill it, or whatever -What was mentioned with the smoothwall tweak above, only walls of the same mineral will connect, so it all looks very nice -Doors and walls made of uranium emit radiation when interacted with, with walls causing a 'ripple' effect, so the more walls nearby, the more radiation you get hit with -Doors and walls made of plasma burn. It's a short, quick burn, but can easily be compounded in large structures --As a note on plasma walls, I cannot get atmos and plasma walls to play nice (Since they are airless turfs), so I can't actually get them to ignite based on air temperature, but when they do ignite, they will auto-magically ignite nearby plasma walls, with a reduced temperature, meaning that if you want a massive chain reaction over a huge area, you better use something a bit hotter than a lighter --Also, when plasma walls burn, they simply leave behind a girder, while doors leave assemblies -Lastly, for nearly any kind of destructive action, Diamond walls are much more resilient, meaning they will take twice as long to be destroyed, and are immune to the effects of thermite (Also, sprites for plasma walls and uranium walls are shite right now, waiting for replacements) Update: -Added cult walls as a 'mineral wall', meaning they will work on the same system and 'ReplaceWithMineralWall("cult")' will change any turf into a cult wall, hopefully for some cult-related activities soon R&D stuff: -Now instead of 1 sheet or ALL OF THE SHEETS, you enter a number as to how many sheets you want (it's sanitized to hell as well) -Minerals no longer multiply when inside RnD machines. (Who fucked that one up? Goddamn) -Mech fabricators are both deconstructable, and putting higher level parts actually improve it, each 'Tier' up is equivalent to +1 tech levels for that, so a High Powered Micro Laser would give the same bonus as +1 Material Research, a Pico Manipulator would give the same bonus as +2 Engineering, etc -Complete with a shitty opened Mech Fab sprite! -And not shitty overlays so autolathe's animate the material that is put in them, rather than give everything that's not glass the metal animation LOL THE JOKES ON YOU I JUST COPY PASTED HIS TOPIC added a few svn ignores, for thumbs.db and maps/backup git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3751 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Updated toilets. You can now crowbar open the cistern and hide stuff in there. Recoded stunbatons, and put them into their own stunbaton.dm. They should function more or less the same, there's a few differences. Recoded rechargers, they function exactly the same, but should be a bit more responsive now. Fixed issue 475. Filing cabinets, photocopiers, and hydroponics trays are now unwrenchable (the latter by request of Cheridan. It may need balancing, or more steps to unanchor.) git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3749 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Added checks for the player being dead, stunned, unconcious ect... to: - Timers - Remote Signallers (Fixes issue 325) - Proximity Sensors - Infared Sensors (Man.. these really need to be fixed.. or just re-done entierly) Cargo shuttle: - People in the area of the cargo shuttle get gibbed when the shuttle shows up. (Fixes issue 508) - Renamed 'Dock' to 'Away' because Station -> Dock is confusing... Committing for Sieve: - The toggle throw hotkey (end) now works with TK (Fixes issue 523) - Borg diamond drills now properly dig sand (I still don't understand why they don't just have a shovel...) Updated changelog to reflect some of these changes. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3747 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Welding tool: Mostly code-related, the players won't notice much. - Welding tool code how has proper comments! Maybe not "proper" but at least I don't lie and say a proc is/does something that it doesn't actually do. - Welders now start full of fuel instead of some random amount between 10-20 - Someone decided it would be a good idea to set the welding tool's 'on/off' var in a ton of attackby() procs. These objects and turfs shouldnt even touch this variable. This is why people have been noticing their welding being on without the sprite or damagetype and amount reflecting that. - - I've removed a bunch of these instances but there are so many objects and turfs spread out through the code, there's no way to know if I've got them all (This is the majority of the files) - - I've created a new proc in welding tools that checks to see if they are turned on or not. "isOn()" - - Since I'm not sure if I've gotten every instance of this force-var-on, I've set the welding tool to update it's icon every process(). I hate adding checks like this to processes but it's necessary for now. - Added a setWelding() proc. If you HAVE to turn the welding tool on or off, use this, don't just change the var. In fact, dont even touch the 'welding' var anymore - Fixes issue 435 While changing the hundreds(literally) of cases of welding tool uses I've - Changed some :'s (object:varorproc) I've come across into .'s (object.varorproc) - Added checks to make sure the welding tool is actually on before using it (some attackby()'s didnt have this. Heck, some checked how much fuel you had, but didn't actually USE the fuel) - Added sanity checks after some do_after()s that were missing them Added traitor uplink items back to erro's stat tracker - Added 'random' with the tag "RN" - Added thermal meson glasses with the tag "TM" - Reorganized uplinks.dm a little by moving the 'random' item generation to its own proc - NOTE: I have absolutely no way to test this on my own, but it should work! I've tested a bunch of construction/deconstructions with the welding tool, but again I've probably missed a few things. If there are any problems, please let me know and I'll fix them asap. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3741 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 - Clicking the intent button now cycles through intents - Removed the mouseover thing for intent switching - Added an 'equip' button to the old hud (just this one for now) which equips the item in your hand to the appropriate slot. - Prevented the intent switching hotkey from spamming your chat when you use it. - Mousing over the intent button now switches it's icon to the four 16x16 intent icons, arranged in a 2x2 grid. Clicking anywhere on the icon will still cycle through the intents, it won't auto-select the intent you clicked on. The icon-swap thing exists only to better illustrate how many times you need to click to get to the intent you wish to get to. Hopefully the new intent switching method works better.

 Readded detective work, with much bugfixing and optimizations. Any PDA that can access the Security Records can, via the forensic scanner function (that was already there) store data on what was scanned, the same way that the Detective's scanner can.

 Changed a bunch of constants to defines and made setup.dm all pretty and easy to read. Defined some clothing-overlay layers. The defines are float-layers. So they will always appear above the mob they are overlaying. They can be found in setup.dm This pretty much means you can change to order in which the icons are added to the overlays variable without fear of eyes appearing above glasses and such. So no more of these dumb bugs.

 Window doors are now breakable - Window doors currently have 200 health, this can and will change if break ins become too common. - They still do not have wires, so you can not 'hack' them that way. - As always, emags still hack open window doors Changes to the hidden mining room treasures. - Added quality pickaxes, jackhammers and drills as a possible treasure. - - Higher quality tools are rarer of course - - Plasma cutter is possible but rare - Added a ripley (equipped with a drill and hydrolic clamp) as a possible treasure. - - There is a chance for the ripley to have a diamond drill instead of a regular drill. Modified the resource crate. - - It no longer always gives you multiple stacks of every mineral. - - It now gives you a chance to get each mineral based on rarity. - - The size of the mineral stack is also partly based on rarity. - - There is a very small chance to recieve nothing in this crate. - - There is a very small chance to recieve a jetpack in this crate ontop of the metal.

 Fixed r500 (faces displaying above glasses and such) Cause: face layer was set to MOB_LAYER. Fixed r501 (underwear not showing) Cause: bad indentation A possible fix for some very odd bugs caused by restarting the MC related to the usr variable being passed into the MC. *shrug* Very hard to test. Removed the need for the world to be in Debug2 mode to edit ticklag as the verb is hidden behind another proc now anyway, and it's become more of an annoyance than a thing to stop people accidentally clicking it. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3695 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Ban moved into IsBanned so that people whom are banned can actually see -why- they are banned. Another perk of using IsBanned and not client/New() is that we now disconnect potential clients before they are given a client object and start downloading any resources...which is like a 30Mb saving per failed login (after each server update). Tidied up the Login and Logout procs for mobs. Moved the sandbox buildmode stuff to mob/living/login.dm so you shouldn't have to log-out and back in to enable build mode. Removed the logged_in variable for mobs as it was the most pointless thing ever. Made the multikeying checks a separate proc. People are checked the second they get a new_player mob. Its notices are also less spammy. Changed AllowUpload from the default. It now restricts uploads of over 1Mb to prevent admins uploading massive .Oggs and lagging the server to hell whilst it sends the ogg to 40+ players. Feel free to change the limit. Moved some of the core client procs into one folder; they should really be together and not in /modules/mob/mob.dm and various other places. I will be giving the client stuff a belated spring-clean over the next few commits, just got to iron out some of the kinks. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3694 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 There's a metric assload of stuff here, mostly in preparation to my massive traitor expansion, so I'll try to be brief: - I added in the foundations for traitor factions. See factions.dm for all the different faction datums. They don't do anything yet. - I completely ported mob/var/mutations from a bitfield to a generic list. Mutation enumerated-identifiers are added into this list. For instance, TK = 1, COLD_RESISTANCE = 2, XRAY = 3, etc... The purpose of this was because bitwise operations could not actually be used after a certain size (because BYOND is stuck in the 16bit era). - I've added in completely-functional nano-augmentations. Check under implantnanoaug.dm for a list of implants and implaners. As mentioned previously, they are completely functional but may be slightly OP. Among these nanoaugs are Super Strength, Psionic Radar, Electric Hands, Energy Blade/Sword Synthesizer, Rebreather, Dermal Armor, Combat Reflexes, and Regenerative Nanorobots. I won't go into detail as to what they do, but hopefully they should be self-explanitory. If not, check out their descriptions in the file previously mentioned. - Added in a future traitor item, the Mind Batterer. Along with it a new .ogg file. - New telecomms bus mainframe sprite, thanks to WJohnston. - New holdable shield, sprites courtesy of Muncher (i had to mangle the side sprites because of a technical little issue. I'll change it back to the original soon). It can be retracted and expanded. Probably only going to be given to traitors. - A couple of minor bugfixes here and there, along with some code tidying. Hope this isn't too large a commit. I intended it to be MUCH larger, but I've decided to split up my Traitor Factions expansion into smaller commits. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3692 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Revolutionary update! You can now dispense Disposal Bins, Outlets and Chutes from the disposal dispenser.

 Updated toilets, urinals, and showers with NEW features. The shower path has changed! From /obj/structure/shower to /obj/machinery/shower Made bookcases appear empty if they have no books, and fill up as more books are placed in them.

 A very simple anti link-spam thingy. I've tried to set it as high as possible without it being uncomfortable. But if text-links seem unresponsive just lower TOPIC_SPAM_DELAY.

Nothing drastic. Added Cheri's puddles. Updated showers, they actually clean now. They're pretty powerful, so I'm going to add a way to make them lethal, to ensure the washing machines still get some use. Updated hydroponics trays, to make them work better with soil.

 - Made a small change to the window UI. The forum and wiki buttons are moved a little to the right to create some whitespace between the browser+info and wiki+forum buttons, since the browser+info buttons tend to get used more. In addition I added a message that gets displayed when someone clicks the button when the wiki and forum addresses are not configured in the files. The last change is a confirmation message which shows up when you click the wiki and forum buttons. This is because people often clicked the wiki button in error, which then opened up a browser, took focus away from the game and all that unfun stuff. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3600 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Random button added to traitor uplinks. - All traitor items are available in the random button so long as you have the crystals to purchase it. - This means it's possible (though very unlikely) to get 5 sets of revolver ammo. - It's RANDOM, don't expect great stuff every time. Made startSinglo() a game-master only verb in the debug tab. - It is incredibly useful and time saving when testing stuff out before committing.

 Fixed issue 411. (Thanks Yvarov- http://nanotrasen.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=8651) Added Invisty's new field generator sprites. Added a button to check antagonists that stops the world from automatically restarting at round end. It's toggleable, but once the round ends with it on, you'll need to reboot the world manually. (It's under check antagonists because that's where the shuttle stuff is, let me know if I should move it.) git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3565 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Removes bloodloss, makes organs tick only every 5 ticks. We'll see if that fixes the lag at all.

 Added Ikarrus's latest map updates. Changes to genetics, medbay, research and security. Updated operating tables to search for adjacent computers, rather than using an ID. Switched back to the old bodybag sprites. Slightly updated the Oddy destroyed sprites, and updated the changelog. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3547 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Changed the way facial scarring works. Instead of setting your real_name to "Unknown" it uses the disfigured variable of a human's head organ to dictate the human's name variable. This means real_name is now somewhat back to being a reliable source of the mob's actual name. It should eliminate a lot of the "cloning as unknown" bugs. It also means I could simplify that god-awful name updating stuff into a nice and simple helper proc. Some original_name stuff was added here and there, mainly during cloning. A lot of the "getting random ghost names" should be fixed now. Still loads to do though, particularly with transforms and such. >_> Fixed a runtime with Tajarans trying to use a variable that doesn't exist for PDAs. Removed that variable from IDs as it's only used by furries. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3546 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Fixes a pAI requests runtime caused by clients disconnecting. Fixes a host of runtimes caused by lag delaying "transmissions" between telecomms machines. Various objects were being deconstructed during this lagtime resulting in a bunch of weird null errors. Tested for 24hours on another server. Seems to be all ok. Added some rudimentary checks to advanced proccall. Calling procs owned by objects is now a little less prone to runtimes. still a bunch of stuff to do to get it safe enough though. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3542 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Adds BS12 dismemberment. Not all features of it are implemented yet, but it should be equal to our previous system. Adds greater changeling code, but doesn't change the genome count yet on it. Renames registered to registered_name on IDs because bs12 had it and it seemed like a good idea to do last night. For some reason. Adds an afterattack to mobs that can be used. (In fairness, lots of shit in attack_hand should be in there instead, like stungloves and stuff, to minimize duplicated code) git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3537 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 - Added a rudimentary transformation section to the options panel (show player panel verb). This allows rudimentary mob type changes to any mob. These are however generic and non-mob-specific, as they only copy over some of the most needed variables, such as the three name variables, dna and mind. They do not, for instance, create a MMI for cyborgs. A note of this is also added to the player panel. - Once you click one of the links a popup will appear asking you whether you'd like to delete the old mob of the player (yes or no) or cancel this transformation.

These changes were made to make right clicking a mob not show a million unneeded verbs.

 Fixed dust() and gib() leaving invisible overlays everywhere Fixed deaths at the end of nuke rounds, optimised the code a little gib() is now hgib() (ie it's specific to humans). gibs.dm() now only spawns generic gibs that could be from any mob. Likewise for dust. Awaiting generic dust() and gib() animations. Fixed (hopefully, depends if firewalls block this method) getruntimelog. GameMasters no longer have the getruntimelog verb. Instead they have .giverutimelog . This allows them to grant a specific client access to the server's runtime logs. (they can grant themself access this way too). NOTE: runtime logs can be used to meta, only grant access to coders or people you trust. It may also be wise to ensure they do not play in the current round. Introducing .getserverlog . It allows any admin above moderator to access ANY archived server/attack logs. Should mkae processing forum ban requests a lot easier since all admins with ban capabilities now have access. getruntimelog renamed to .getruntimelog . File-request spam prevention increased to 60seconds to discourage access serverlogs too much! They can reach sizes of 4Mb sometimes so please be responsible with them admins. runtime logs should now be saved to /data/logs/runtime/ (you may have to create this folder yourself) ummm... fixed gibs appearing below shuttle turfs. Trimmed some uneeded fluff text from the logs. PHEW git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3509 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Adds tickcomp, an attempt to make mob movement speeds level across all tickrates. Works pretty well. Adds a (disabled) framework for making people drop where they're stunned without waiting for the next tick Shuffles sleeping and resting, making them cause effects of their own rather than just relying on 2 ticks of paralysis or whatever. You now stand up before being able to move again (called in canmove) Reduces slip chance from 50 to 0 when knocked out (more in line with the comments in the code, and it just makes more sense) git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3503 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Rewrote the cinematic system to be centralised and controlled by the gameticker, rather than handled per mob with like, 3 loops and a seperate process for each mob.dmPlease report any bugs/derps to me asap. I've tested it as much as I can locally, but because it relates to events that require a large number of players it's very hard to test. TODO: I was intending to use dust to kill players off on a nuclear-loss. However dust() is very very broken. So I've hardcoded everything to die until I can fix dust(). Added an adminverb for 'Game Master's. It was a debug verb so I could test cinematics but I've left it in as it might be handy for events, especially if we get more cinematics. To access it type "cinematic" in full into the input bar as a Game Master, then follow the prompts. At the moment, it only handles nuclear stuff (that's all there is anyway). You can choose where the nuke detonated 0= on station; 1= near station but in space; 2= off the z-level. You can also force a cinematic from another game-mode to play with the prompt after that one. Note: All mobs are buckled to a bed located inside the gameticker (odd I know) whilst a cinematic is playing. The bed is deleted afterwards releasing all players. If off_station=0 then all mobs will be killed too. This is to stop people running around and doing stuff during the cinematic. I really didn't want to add more variables/checks to mobs. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3481 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 New Verb added for "Game Master"s: getruntimelog This verb can only be accessed by typing it in full in the input bar down the bottom of the gamescreen. HOW DO I LOG RUNTIMES? Firstly, start dreamdeamon if it isn't already running. Then select "world>Log Session" in dreamdeamon (or press the F3 key) navigate the popup window to the log/runtime/ folder from where your tgstation .dmb is located. OPTIONAL: you can select the little checkbox down the bottom to make dreamdeamon save the log everytime you start a world. Just remember to repeat these steps with a new name when you update to a new revision! Save it with the name of the revision your server uses (e.g. r3459.txt). This will allow us to gather information on bugs across multiple servers simply by logging on as a player and asking any Game Master to send us the logs. Hence making maintaining our codebase for the entire community a TONNE easier :3 If you're keeping runtime logs: Thanks for your help! ~love from #coderbus git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3475 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

This means that you will no longer see the black edge, transition will likely happen without you even noticing. - The distance from the edge that defines this is in setup.dm, the variable is called TRANSITIONEDGE and is currently set to 7 (the view range). - Moved the DJ station a few tiles to the south east to make z-level transition in that area smoother. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3464 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

You can enable them by calling the verb 'debug verbs'. 'debug verbs' remains game-master only, as it is just for debugging stuff. For a non-game master to use the 'assume direct control' verb, they have to use view variables - it was added to the drop-down. Some procs were moved around.

 Fixed my derp in cmd_admin_pm where the input popup was being displayed to usr rather than src (usr is the mob src is the client) AdminHelps are now client verbs rather than mob verbs. Which means adminhelp can be called from cmd_admin_pm when an admin disconnects or something. This will stop non-admins getting the message "Client not found" (read as: license to grieffe) when an admin disconnects for whatever reason.

 Added the foundations of a special-day events system. It's a bit more robust, tidy and efficient than calling isDay everywhere. It defaults to disabled. It can be enabled by uncommenting ALLOW_HOLIDAYS in config/config.txt I've added no content just the foundations. All it does is give the station a holiday themed name and say "Happy [Holiday] Everybody!" at the round-start. Added a .Set Holiday verb for GM and GA Admins. I'd rather people didn't use it for now (there's not much point as there's no content yet anyway). It's mainly for bugtesting. Foundations are there to create holiday random events and round-start stuff so we can keep everything together. Check out code/game/gamemodes/events/holidays ! NOTE: This is intended for easter eggs! Little trinkets and such to make these days special. It IS NOT for spawning grief items and game-changing stuff. If you REALLY want to add stuff like that, please speak to the project heads.

 Rewrote blackholes (gravitational anomalies) and wormholes to try and optimise them a little. If you have any concerns about how I've done so just give me a shout and I'll either rework them or revert my changes back. Wormholes especially seem a bit faster on my laptop. Smoke has temporarily been removed from the blackhole event until I get time to investigate why the hell effect_systems are using so much memory ( spark effects were using 40% of my processor a second ago D: ). To compensate this I made them a new sprite. Commented out the authentication system. It was the remnants of the old goon authentication stuff (or maybe even older) and wasn't actually used in our code at all (at least not in any useful way, it was merely called and short-circuited to 1, so all those if(authenticated) were totally pointless. This has removed 3 unused variables from every client, a bunch of unused variables from the config and two empty text files! Committed (as a config option) a feature requested by Apoc station. It causes a 'reply to' window to popup when an admin PMs a non-admin player. It's meant to grab their attention so they can't say "I didn't see your PM". It defaults to off.

 •Fixed Issue 440 and made sleep work as intended. http://code.google.com/p/tgstation13/issues/detail?id=440 ◘The problem: People being able to move while resting/lying ◘What caused it: When a user decided to press "rest", a single variable, resting, was switched from 0 to 1. Through life.dm procs, when the handle_regular_status() proc saw the mob resting && his weakness being 0 or less, it would just give him 2 seconds of being-weak, through Weaken(2). Later on, the proc called update_canmove() to see if the guy had the ability to move due to weakness but also due to reagents/drugs/sleep etc. At every tick, this proc also reduced mob.weakness by 1. The chain that led to the problem was: ○User decides to rest ○resting is set to 1, handle_regular_status_updates() runs ○Proc sees that the user's resting var == 1. Does mob.weakness = 2 ○Proc handles weakness. mob.weakness -= 1. It is now 1. ○update_canmove() is blind to resting, though sees that there's weakness. Sets canmove to 0 ○Proc runs again the following second ○Proc sees user is resting. ○mob.weakness <= 0 fails, since it's 1 from the last run. Weakness stays at 1. ○Proc handles weakness, mob.weakness-=1. It is now 0. ○update_canmove() now sees that there's no weakness, and sets canmove to 1, even though the user is still resting & lying ○For a second, the user is able to roll around on his lying butt ○Proc runs again, giving Weaken(2) and disables movement again, and the circle repeats. ◘How it got fixed: Made update_canmove() not blind to resting. I don't like this solution, as resting still equals weakening and there's wasted processing, albeit miniscule. I will try to work on something better. ◘Sleep can now go over 1 again, some dumb shit did not realise this and led to sleep being weak as hell. You can now put people to permanent sleep through anaesthetic gasses and toxins. Deciding to sleep will put you out for 20. Deciding to faint will put you out for 10. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3442 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Fixing dem runtimes: Temp-fix for mob/say.dm It's being sent null from Tcomms, so I'll leave it to somebody with experience with that.

 An attempt to make the master controller more robust. This shouldn't cause terrible additional lag, given that the master controller doesn't actually fire that often, and can also give us a clue as to what part of the controller has died in case of failure Modifies do_after to something that fires a lot less, and is hopefully more robust against infinite loops.

 Adds randomlly spawning rooms to the mining asteroid that contain various goodies. (Among them are a modified traitor beacon, a cloaking device and a closet full of resources so you can go build your own honk.) These rooms will spawn at least out of range of space and the explored pathways, so at the very least some mining is required to even detect them with mesons. Adds a borg upgrade system. Right now, it just contians a borg reset module that allows the borg to choose their module again. Adds some support code to borgs to suppot flashproofing and renaming.

Admin to Admin PMs are no longer annoying and LOUD: "-- ADMIN PRIVATE MESSAGE --" All Admin PM messages to non-admins are now 'LOUD'. Admin-PM verb is now sorted by Mob rather than client as per request Can again PM mobs by right clicking them.

 Modest update to Botany. -Enabled potato batteries. Make them by adding wiring. They're weak and unreliable, but might be useful in emergency outages. -Added potency and bitesize variables to many plants that were missing it, along with some other minor adjustments to vegetation defines. Removed (unnecessary) default potency from grass seeds. Gave Ambrosia Vulgaris seeds default potency, but lowered the yield a bit. -Deathberries now contain some lexorin as well as toxin, and as such are especially true to their name. -Added splat ability to blue tomatoes and blood tomatoes. Blood-tomatoes will leave a blood stain on the floor. Blue-tomatoes will spill their slippery contents. Watch your step! -Removed the undefined opium from poppies, replaced it with a painkiller that actually works (bicaridine). -Bug that prevented tower caps from spawning as random weeds fixed. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3378 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Adds a dummy process() to /obj/machinery/door so that doors aren't removed from the machine list. Best guess, all machines call process automatically, and because doors didn't have an explicit one defined, they automatically called the one that removed them from the list.

 Cargo shuttle no longer takes you to Centcomm - Created far more robust method of detecting beacons/humans/mechs on the cargo shuttle. As a result: - It is no longer possible to send mobs/mechs/tracking beacons to Centcomm. - It is no longer possible to send the nuke disk away on the shuttle. (This should prevent people from magically duplicating nuke disks) - Centcomm cargo techs now clean up the shuttle when it arrives in case something somehow manages to bypass the previous checks. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3373 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Removes poo. XSI and co. weren't very fond of it, and the last thing I would do is make them uncomfortable and challenge their leadership by keeping poo in. An experimental lagfix, which removes a couple THOUSAND unnecessary machines from the machine processing list. Please report any unresponsive machinery (as result of this commit) as HIGH PRIORITY issues. I'm not quite sure how much lag this will kill, but I'm confident that it will be at least slightly noticeable. More work on step_triggers.

They were clogging that vent list up as fuck * Vents pressure settings now have an extra href which resets the vent to ONE_ATMOSPHERE kPa (101.32 or whatever it is) - The "Outlet position is obstructed" error message when opening exofab now only appears if the turf to south is obstructed, not to east like before. - AI Modules use attack_self instead of attack_hand - Fixed chatspam with reverse() and made the explode function use the builtin ss13 one instead of my custom, it proved to be faster. - Added my self to the changelog, because I can! git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3367 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Using a minihoe on a Hydroponics tray removes all the weeds in the tray at once. Using a bucket on a sink now fills it entirely with water, instead of 10 units at a time.

Uncommented tower caps from the weed overgrowth options (they were commented out previously because they weren't done, but they're fully implemented now).

 Add a protective_temperature var to paper, so when it is used as a paper hat doesn't cause a fuckton of runtimes when exposed to fire. (It gives zero protection however) git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3305 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Fixed HoS locker vanishing when emagged Commented out bloody footprints until someone can figure out a sane way to prevent there being hundreds if not thousands of decals a round. Reverted Doohl's riot armour/ablative armour changes (the code for reflection is just commented out, neat stuff) Fixed the typo on the CE's request console git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3304 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Minor touch-ups to the shiny new job-ban interface Antag job-bans should now work correctly for the role assigner thingy at the start of a round. Removed the Malf-AI job-ban option, as it was a pain to implement and wasn't really worth it. Tensioner doesn't recognise job-bans to the best of my knowledge. This may change in the future. -- Nodrak & Carnwennan git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3295 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Commented out the forensics gear (scanners, fingerprint cards, etc) spawning on the detective and in his locker. They're completely non functional at the moment and cause a runtime literally every time they are used, better he not have them at all than the server get raped while we wait for the stuff to be fixed. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3293 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Changed blood application to make the weapon bloody, rather than the hands of the attacked mob. Improved the item blood sprite. Fixed a spelling error causing shoe blood to not be applied onmob. Improved a few random sprites. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3291 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Blood_DNA fixes. Bloodied icons rewritten to be overlays, not replacing the icons. Hopefully this should fix \icon[src] breaking everything. Bloodied hands/gloves don't transfer blood to infinite amounts of touched items. Please report any bugs! git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3290 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Some work on aliens. I'll finish this up soon. Gave riot shields a 99% chance of blocking pushers from pushing their wielders (given their wielder is not on the help intent). Added a projectile reflection mechanic. Ablative Armor will often, when the groin or torso is struck, deflect projectiles back to the tile they came from (not back the original shooter). Deflected projectiles aren't 100% accurate, so ablative armor can result in friendly fire. Hopefully stopped humans from waking up 1 second after they fall asleep. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3286 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Updates handheld-flashes so that they cannot break on their first use. Their chance of breaking is directly proportional to their frequency of use (ranges from 0% to 5%, used to be a blanket 2%). Their capacitor recharges one charge every 60 seconds. Once their 6 charges are used up, they temporarily stop working whilst their capacitor recharges. This should mean that flashes will last a long time with light use (defence/rev), but not for spamming (shitcurity). Can now job-ban people from entire departments through the jobban panel. Can now job-ban people even if they log out. Job-ban panel now informs you why people were banned from each job. Runtime fixes for some old jobban code that was preventing the above stuff. Committing some fixes Nodrak pointed out. Credits go to Nodrak for a lot of this. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3285 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Holy crap BYOND is retarded. ;-; \icons[object.icon] does not work correctly and may cause client crashes. This totally doesn't happen when testing locally so I guess the icon stuff must be done client-side/be lag-induced or something? I've also noticed that icon-updating is very slow (items tend to disappear briefly when being made bloody looking). With the recent forensics updates everything gets bloody, resulting in massive bulshit. I am working on a rewrite of bloodied-icons. For now, this should stop runtimes from examining humans caked in blood. Unfortunately the little icons in the chat-log will no longer be visible when items are bloody, I hope to fix this with said rewrite of bloodied-icons. Moved the paper_talisman icon into bureaucracy.dmi to make Cult mode playable. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3277 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Adds a new config option called 'Tensioner'. If enabled, if the tensioner thinks the round is going too slow (Not enough deaths and explosions, pretty much, atm) it suggests adding more antagonists. Unless overriden by an admin (any holder) it automatically creates antagonists from a random round type. Feedback and round-end conditions (except for nuke team) will not (should not) function for additional antagonists. Tratior borgs who hack themselves cannot be blown by their AI. The AI can now open doors with shift+click, bolt them with ctrl+click, and shock them with alt+click Adds a new wire to doors that controls the time delay before they close. If pulsed, they close like a sliding glass door. If cut, they do not close by themselves. Borgs who have died, ghosts, and are then blown up will now have their ghosts properly transfered to their dropped MMIs. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3269 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Removed meat rotting and all associated code in freezers/fridges etc. Reconnected the freezer room to station atmos, removed its miniature freezing loop thing, starts at a normal temperature, etc. Moved meat back off the floor and into a fridge. Reasoning for all this being the game has been laggy enough as of late, we don't need meat and closets processing, and we certainly do not need the chef putting strain on the atmos system every single time he opens the door to his freezer room, especially not for such a trivial thing as rotting meat. REMOVAL APPROVED BY MUSKETS COME AT ME BRO Also re-added Lamaar to the RD's office. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3261 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Large bureaucracy overhaul. This affects clipboards, hand labelers, paper, paper bins, pens, photocopiers, and stamps. Everything (that I've changed significantly) should be BETTER. NO paths have been changed. All of the above have been added to the paperwork module (pending rename to bureaucracy, which is COOLER). SPRITES for most of the above (except photocopiers) are now in bureaucracy.dmi. Clipboards in particular are MASSIVELY IMPROVED. Hand labelers can now be turned ON AND OFF, to make it simpler to avoid labelling tables. This includes work in progress FOLDERS, which currently do NOTHING. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3253 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Modified TK to be more effective and polished. You can use the TK grab to interact with machines and stuff from far away (but you cannot pick them up!). This means you can also bonk people with items you are holding with your TK grab. Changed the energy gun sprites to a better-looking version, made by Khodoque! More work on NTSL. Including the ability to create comments by using // and /* insert comment here */. Removed the traffic control machine from telecomms, as requested by Urist. NTSL is still a work in progress, and needs to be completely fool-proof before players can get anywhere near it. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3252 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Committing fixes to code for examining mobs. Burn damage wasn't showing properly on some mobs. Fixed grammar, icons and stuff. Added some stylesheet classes. Approved by Urist. If you're adding game text, please use the class that best describes the text. This way all the text formatting can be edited from the stylesheet rather than traipsing through the code like I am. Cyborg names reflect their module choice. Cyborgs can no longer drop their module-items on conveyor belts.

 Integrated BS12's improved uplink code, courtesy of SkyMarshal. This means items now spawn in your hand if possible, items are sorted into categories, and only items you have enough telecrystals to purchase will be displayed.

 More work done on Telecomms: ▫ Signals can now be rejected by Subspace broadcasters through a specific data[] parameter. ▫ Improved the log browser. ▫ Log browsers and telecommunication monitors no longer require access to use. You do need access to delete logs, however. ▫ Intercoms need power to work. They don't drain power, they just need a constant flow of equipment power. As such, that offline intercom sprite's now finally being put to use. Scripting language: ▫ Sorry about all the files; they're all necessary! It's important to notice that the basic structure of the scripting language code is not mine; I cannibalized the base structure from some obscure BYOND project. It's pretty well documented, and I'd say easier to browse through than atmos. Here's the basic deal: A compiler datum manages the relationships between the three main subsystems of a scripting language: the Scanner, the Parser, and the Interpreter. The Scanner splits raw text into token datums that the Parser can read. The Parser transforms the otherwise random bits and strings into ordered AST Trees and nodes for the Interpreter to read. The interpreter actually executes the code and handles scope/functions/code blocks. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3193 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Headsets are now modular, and come with encryption keys that correspond to secure channels. Currently, encryption keys are based around previous groupings (HoS encrpytion key, Captain encrpytion key). Consideration was made to giving an encrpytion key for each channel (Security encryption key, Command encryption key), and might be switched to that. Turns the binary translator into an encryption key and makes it actually work properly. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3189 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Changed the jetpack naming scheme to something more logical. /obj/item/weapon/tank/jetpack/void /obj/item/weapon/tank/jetpack/oxygen /obj/item/weapon/tank/jetpack/carbondioxide Updated the maps so they don't have empty jetpacks in EVA. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3151 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Jetpacks can now use any gas. The /obj/item/weapon/tank/jetpack path is now an empty jetpack, and oxygen and carbon dioxide filled jetpacks are /obj/item/weapon/tank/jetpack/blue_jetpack and /obj/item/weapon/tank/jetpack/black_jetpack respectively.

NOTE TO URIST: to enable this, you only have to uncomment the part with your name in machine_processing.dm Everything else is already in working order.

 Sanity check for facehuggers. Sanity checks galore for simple_animals (if(list) behaviour seems to have changed lately). Humans once again get their bodies burned into husks in fire.

 Desert Eagles now use magazines, .50AE ammo, and only have 7 shots. They're basically revolvers that use magazines. Nuke ops lost that horribly nerfed piece of shit c20r and now get Desert Eagles and Riot Shields. The detectives .38 ammo now does the same damage as regular revolver bullets. If he wants to keep acting as a glorified sec officer, he can go grab a taser. The Veil Render now summons a subtype of Nar-Sie which doesn't pull anchored objects. This should reduce the power of the item/reduce lag while I get sprites and finalize details with Urist for reworking it as the Sphere of Annihilation (as in, this is temporary) Updated the changelog git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3132 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Added Spacevines to the random events. Added a spawn space-vines option to the secrets panel. Fixes issue 250 (borg door bug) Fixed silicon interactions with engineering equipment. Fixed access lists for radiation collectors, so locking them actually serves a purpose. Fixed using crowbars on them. Borgs can name themselves upon module selection (unless a roboticist has named them previously by using a pen) To avoid Borgs griefing and then changing their name by selecting a module, borgs are now unable to move independently until they choose a module. New sprites for spacevines are on the way. So you'll have to tolerate my crappy stand-ins for a bit until he is finished with them. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3128 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Chaplains are no longer immune to cult magic. Instead, a new item, the null rod, spawns in the chaplains office. Having the rod on your person will make you immune to cult magic. Runes are now dispelled with the null rod, not the bible. Chaplains can no longer self heal with the bible. Simple animals can now attack mechas and critters Constructs no longer take extra damage from bibles. Fueltanks now explode when shot by lasers or bullets. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3125 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 - All PM links are now tied to clients and not mobs. What this means is that all PM links (the links admins get in admin messages which lead to a PM) should now point directly to the client, if one still exists or report them as disconnected. This means that there should no longer be problems with clients which swap mobs. - Made the player-side admin pm message more visible and obnoxious. Some players might find it annoying but at least it will not leave much room to complain about "missing PM-s" Screenshot: http://www.kamletos.si/admin%20message%20format.PNG - Fixed that awkward X in asay messages, which moved whatever mob you were in to the location of the person who said the message. Replaced it with JMP, which does the same as the JMP in adminhelps - makes a ghost and moves that ghost to the location: Screenshot: http://www.kamletos.si/admin%20say.PNG - Ghosts which find themselves locked in any form of container (closets most commonly) will now (FINALLY) exit the container (and it is any container!) after they click one of the arrow keys. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3121 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 - So apparently Pete was too afraid to do this but apparently it's been approved, requested and in the waiting for weeks... Replaced the public autolathe with a photocopier, decided a photocopier doesn't need it's own room, so I moved the photocopier to the library and removed the autolathe room. I'm sure we'll soon have something more exciting to fill up the area.

 - Profiles that were created before ghost ears was added had their ghost_ears value set to null, which then copied over. the profile setup page understood this as "hears everyone" while the game understood this as null, which is neither "hears everyone" nor "nearby creatures only", but it took null as 0, so it defaulted to "nearby creatures only". Applied a legacyfix that will properly update the profiles of everyone who does not yet have this set. - To fix this for your own character before this goes live, just toggle the ghost-ears setting on your profile setup page at least once and then select the option you wish to have. Then save the profile. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3116 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 - Desk lamps are now just fancy flashlights. Which means you can pick them up. They have w_class set to 4 and don't have the onbelt flag, meaning you can't put them in any container and you can't put them in a pocket. Click on them to pick them up, use the toggle-light verb to turn them on or off. They are no longer affected by light switches (desk lights generally aren't anyway) - Updated lamp type path on both uterus and 2.0.8 git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3115 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

Note: I upped the delay a little as it was still pretty spammable when I tested it, seems to be fine now as it's way more effort than it's worth to empty a vending machine. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3107 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

The robotics headset has engineering and science channels. - Virologist now spawns with the medsci headset instead of the medical headset. The medsci headset has medical and science channels. With this there are now extra headsets for every job. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3091 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Summon Guns now only has a 25% (for each person) to give them the traitor message, though everyone still gets a gun. Fixed the Veil Render sprite, I'd left part of the outline from cutting it out of the grid Ausops sent me. Moved my stuff to a more recent part of the changelog because my ego needs feeding (no seriously because I think things like the chaplain being cult immune or nuke ops getting a teleporter needs to be well known) git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3089 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 - Brought the fire alarm code into the 21st century (replaced the text("blah[][][][]",var,var,var,var)) with the proper "blah[var][var][var][var]" way of writing. - Added an "The current alert level is: %alert%" to fire alarms when you open their interface. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3088 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 - Removed the 'midis' variable from mobs. This one's supposed to be a client thing, so it's now a client side var instead of being doubled in mobs. - Made ooccolor, be_pai, be_alien, midis and ghost_ears actually properly copy over from the preferences when observing! Incredible, isn't it? git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3087 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 - The unpower all areas event now does not unpower engineering and the AI core, meaning the AI is less likely to get screwed over by this and it is no longer a 'release singularity' button. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3086 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 - Power alarms on z level 1 now update to their proper alert level state when spawned. They now spawn with the green alert level overlay at round start. - Removed the window/north, window/east and the other dir-specific window subclasses - Request console global announcements no longer have the leading space - Wrenching wooden table parts now gives wood instead of metal - Replaced the engineering singularity viewing cameras with EMP proof cameras git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3085 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 - Added instructions on how to use the pretty markup to the changelog - Added a few red corner floor pieces to security - Added a Del() proc to blackbox recorders which makes it so a new blackbox recorder gets made when the one is deleted and all the data is copied over, so no data is lost. Same applies when the new one gets deleted. The new blackbox is spawned on z-level 2, so at centcom on the coordinates X,Y,Z = 1,1,2 git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3084 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Changelog updated with my recent commits. Forgot to do this before making the last commit. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3083 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Crayon boxes are now storage items. I have no idea why they weren't storage items to being with but now they are. 6 storage slots, can only hold crayons. Icon_state is properly updated when crayons are taken out as well as when crayons are put in. Updated uterus and 2.0.8 with the new type path, which is /obj/item/weapon/storage/crayonbox git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3082 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 - Moved three (well two, one was doubled for some reason) screen/attackby() procs to appear AFTER the screen object is defined. They were in a random file instead of where the objects are. If you double-click and 'screen' object in the object browser it now takes you to the definition instead of some random file. - Clicking a grille with a glass or r-glass sheet in your hand, when the grille is in one of your cardinal directions (North, south, east or west) will make you start building a window. It takes 2s to build the window, which spawns unfastened (same as when you create one.) This should make fixing damaged grille-window combinations easier. If you are standing on a grille and click it with a glass / r-glass sheet in your hand, the window will face the direction you're currently facing. Screenshot: http://www.kamletos.si/placing%20windows%20on%20grilles.PNG git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3081 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 - toggle-hear-radio and toggle-hear-deadcast now properly say whether you will or won't hear the two communication types when toggling them. - added a de-admin-self verb for admins. This exists so admins can play games without having to deal with 2nd accounts and such. It removes all the verbs and deletes the 'holder' object, so admins lose all their verbs, asay, adminhelp/prayer hearing, everything. They are exactly the same as normal players. To return to being an admin someone has to promote you back. The effects of de-admin-self are only for the current round. Coders, when adding new admin verbs, don't forget to also add their removal into /client/proc/clear_admin_verbs() Added jumptocoord, everyone_random and cmd_switch_radio to the proc, so hiding admin verbs works more properly. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3080 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 - Clicking when buckled won't change your facing direction - Clicking on objects which have their pixel_x and pixel_y number larger than +/- 16 will now make you face in the direction they're moved to (IE wall mounted things) git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3079 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 You will now face the direction of the item/turf/mob/anything you're interacting with (or trying to interact with) (applied whenever you click, shift-click or alt-click) Added this to the changelog. (Also added a cigarette paper and cigarette filter sprite, not seen anywhere in-game.) git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3077 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Added a partially constructed teleporter to the syndicate (nuclear) shuttle. It is behind a blast door operated by the same computer that opens the outer airlock to prevent the operatives from using it will still on the centcomm Z level. A teleporter circuit board has been added to the nuke radio, and can be purchased for 20 telecrystals. This will allow them to finish the teleporter onboard their ship. This will be probably be absurdly overpowered and need to be reverted, but no harm in trying it out, right? Moved the teleporter board out secure tech and into the RD's office. Because teleporters cannot be built from scratch, the board serves almost no purpose but to be deconstructed anyway. And having it in the RD's office will prevent nuke teams from stealing it from space to complete their machine. Replaced the mechanical toolboxes on the nuke shuttle with syndicate toolboxes. Updated the changelog git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3076 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 - Added water balloons (sprites courtesy of Sieve,) these can be filled with most reagents and burst on throwing if filled, applying the reagents to whatever is hit (along with everything else on that tile.) These are winnable from the arcade, for now. I'll probably think of a better way to implement them. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3075 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Config now defaults to using the object type spells. Proc spellbook got the Summon Guns spell but I don't want to mess with adding artificer into that system Added a check to stop artefacts from causing runtimes when you try to buy them with 0 points left. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3073 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Added the caution code, sprited by magicbones, not present anywhere on the map http://nanotrasen.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=4548&start=50#p37266 Added a power switch (/obj/structure/powerswitch), which is used to split or connect two cables. The way it works is simple. It connects the powernets by adding cable on the floor it's on and removing it when it's turned off. In-file description: //This is a power switch. When turned on it looks at the cables around the tile that it's on and notes which cables are trying to connect to it. //After it knows this it creates the number of cables from the center to each of the cables attempting to conenct. These cables cannot be removed //with wirecutters. When the switch is turned off it removes all the cables on the tile it's on. //The switch uses a 5s delay to prevent powernet change spamming. Screenshot: http://www.kamletos.si/power%20switch.PNG git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3072 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 New verb: rightandwrong When used, it will arm every human mob that is not already a special role (and with a client assigned) with a random gun from the following list: -Taser -Egun -Laser -Revolver -C20r -Decloner -Desert Eagle -Gyrojet Pistol -Pulse Rifle -Silenced Pistol -Laser Cannon -Combat Shotgun -Mini-Uzi -Mini-Ebow It will then inform the player that "You are the survivor! Your own safety matters above all else, trust no one and kill anyone who gets in your way. However, armed as you are, now would be the perfect time to settle that score or grab that pair of yellow gloves you've been eyeing..." And make them a traitor/give them the objective to survive till the round ends. After use, rightandwrong will remove itself from the users list of verbs. rightandwrong addeded to the Spellbook under "Summon Guns" The verb will appear in the spell tab. Updated changelog git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3071 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Added a new one-use artefact, Veil Render(sprites by Ausops), for the wizard which will summon Nar-Sie after a few seconds of delay. Yes believe it or not I got permission to add this. Added Veil Render to the spellbook Added the effect "rend" as part of Veil Render's summoning process. Rend spawns Nar-Sie and deletes itself after a 3 second delay. Updated the changelog. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3067 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Added a new variable to all mobs: var/original_name This variable is set ONLY when you spawn. It is also only used for deadchat communication. This variable is not to be changed after mob creation. the new deadchat format is: http://www.kamletos.si/deadchat222.png line before suicide = spoke alive just before I suicided (name = unknown; real_name = "Duncan Sagan"; original_name = "Duncan Sagan") the 2nd to last line is me speaking from the human body (name = "Unknown"; real_name = "Duncan Sagan"; original_name = "Duncan Sagan") the last line is me speaking after ghosting (name = "Duncan Sagan"; real_name = "Unknown"; original_name = "Duncan Sagan") So when alive everything is as before, When you speak as a dead human you get DEAD: Original_name says, "message" When you speak as a ghost you get DEAD: Original_name (as real_name) says, "message" (the as real_name is skipped if the two are the same) If there is some overlooked situation where new mobs are created and original names don't copy over, then real_name is used in all forms of deadcast communication. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3066 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 The armoured construct is now known as the Juggernaut. Its health was lowered and it takes massive damage from being hit with a bible. The Juggernaut has a lesser version of force wall. Added the Wraith construct, a faster, more fragile construct which has a lesser version of Ethereal Jaunt. It too is vulnerable to bibles. The Chaplain is now immune to blood boil, stun talismans, and cult blind/deafen Constructs are finally creatable by using a full soulstone on an empty construct shell. The creator will be able to choose which kind of construct is created. Cultists can get construct shells from their supply talisman Wizards now get the spell "Artificer" which allows them to create construct shells for free when they select the soulstone belt. Medical Borgs are now relentless to prevent them losing hold of incapacitated patients. Added the Artificer (conjure construct shell), Phase Shift (lesser jaunt), and Shield (lesser forcewall) spells git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3054 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 The "X FAILS TO PUSH Y'S FAT ASS OUT OF THE WAY" message now only displays to the person shoving, so those nearby are not subjected to chat spam.

 - Brought 2.0.8 and uterus up to date with the new type paths. - Added an atmostech belt that spawns with the same tools as the engineer full belt, just the wire is replaced by an analyzer. - Atmos techs now spawn with this belt - Added a detective-styled personal closet, that contains a satchel, which contains a wallet, which contains one or two spacecash items and a coin. - Slightly redesigned two of the dorm rooms so they have this new cabinet - closet with the stuff mentioned above. - Slightly changed the spawn order of items in engineering closets so that hazard vests spawn above toolboxes. Hopefully this will spare a few fiddly clicks for engineers. - Detective locker now spawns with the locked sprite - Engineering now has the L2 radioactive suit lockers that contain rad suits instead of that crate. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3039 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Examining humans is now smarter and displays only the things you can see. Certain outerwear suits and helmets hide other pieces of clothing on you. A diagram that displays what can hide what: http://www.kamletos.si/inventory%20visibility%20hierarchy.png Note that not all suits and helmets hide stuff. Added this to the changelog. Technical information: Renamed gimmick.dm to z_gimmick.dm because whenever I doubleclicked on any piece of clothing in the object tree it always pointed me to some random gimmick item instead of the root definition. Now the file is at the bottom of the folder and so everything else is looked up first. Created a bitflag variable which is used to determine which piece of clothing hides another. The variable is flags_inv and the flags it contains are: #define HIDEGLOVES 1 //APPLIES ONLY TO THE EXTERIOR SUIT!! #define HIDESUITSTORAGE 2 //APPLIES ONLY TO THE EXTERIOR SUIT!! #define HIDEJUMPSUIT 4 //APPLIES ONLY TO THE EXTERIOR SUIT!! #define HIDESHOES 8 //APPLIES ONLY TO THE EXTERIOR SUIT!! #define HIDEMASK 1 //APPLIES ONLY TO HELMETS!! #define HIDEEARS 2 //APPLIES ONLY TO HELMETS!! #define HIDEEYES 4 //APPLIES ONLY TO HELMETS!! The first 4 only apply to exterior suits and the last 3 only to helmets, so they can use the same numbers. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@3031 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Adds the ability for the Communications Console to send emergency messages to Centcomm (or, when emagged, to the Syndicate.) This messages admins in the same fashion as a prayer. Adds a button to the messages that admins receive from Syndiate/Centcomm messages called 'BSA' and hits the target with bluespace artillery if the message was suitably stupid. Because of the IC act of sending the message as opposed to prayer, does not respect see_prayers. Depending on (ab)use, may be changed git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2921 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Adds a new special object (stop) that can be used when you need someone to stop moving right away, even before the next life(). Used in door crushing to prevent people from inertiaing through. Checks for /obj/special/stop in loc every move. Compared to the number of other checks, I don't expect this to be an undo burden, but can be commented out in case of OH SHIT LAG under heavy load. Moves /area/entered to its own file. Adds a new area var called has_gravity. Determines if floor tiles count for movement control (planning on adding more, currently can only be badmined) Adds a new mob var called lastarea that is updated with the area you're in every time /area/entered is called. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2917 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 I added a new atom-level proc: /atom/ShiftClick(mob) This is called whenever someone clicks on an atom while holding shift. It is not sensitive to distance from object or anything like that. The mob parameter it contains is the mob that clicked the atom. THIS PROC DEFAULTS TO EXAMINE, so if you shift-click something, you will examine it. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2906 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 The old engineering is once again in place. The only things that have changed are the CE's office is a few tiles smaller so that the path from engineering to the break room is straight, a few books laying on the ground are now on tables, and the escape pod has a glass airlock/windows rather than walls leading to it. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2891 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Added two new variables, "canstun" and "canweaken". They can be modified in runtime to prevent mobs from ever being weakened and stunned by tasers/batons/electrified doors. Xenos are immune to stunning and weakening. This basically means you cannot run up to a xeno and shoot them with a taser and game over. This makes them a lot more dangerous. To compensate, I've added in a xeno-exclusive variable controlling movement delay addition. When a xeno is stunned, its movement speed goes down. The speed is recovered in the life() proc. Modifications to critter.dmi (manhacks). Added a new lighting icon, floor lights. Possible implementation later. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2886 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Emitters emp_act now uses severity properly. The PA can no longer be remotely controlled by humans and cyborgs can only control it if they are nearby. The spawn PA can now be taken apart. FireAx/Extinguisher closets got their own files. Food closets are now with their defines. Freezer closet/crates override return_air() to cooldown the contents. The var isinfreezer has been eliminated. The old player panel has been readded as an alt for the new one, it may be found under the Player Panel verb. The new player panel may be accessed by the Player Panel-New verb. Crates.dm moved from the storage folder as it is not a storage object.

 Simple animals (Ian, Shades, etc) no longer suffer stuns/stuttering from projectiles (because it would never wear off) On the other hand, simple animals now take damage from harmful projectiles (bullets, lasers). Because of their low amount of health and lack of armour, this means lasers kill most animals in a single shot (I might need to give them some sort of damage reduction so that poor Ian doesn't get killed in one shot every round). git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2848 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Some more work on the Telecomms: You can now access a hidden maintenance interface in all the telecomm machinery by using a Multitool on them.

 Patched up the three major security risks in engineering: the north CE window facing the hallway, the north engineering window facing the hallway, the regular wall in the smes room.

 Fixed a missing disposal pipe section and APC in Fore Starboard Maintenance Wrapped objects can now be labelled with a pen Wrapped small packages can be picked up, and are now opened by being used on themselves. Added a new disposal pipe part: The wrapsortjunction diverts disposalholders with a tomail value of 1. Disposalholders are given a tomail value of 1 only if they originate from a disposal unit with a package in it. Package wrappers are now w_class = 4.0. This is to prevent bugs when wrapping containers. Mail office remapped such that packages flushed down disposals end up on a special table. Package wrappers placed in most of the station departments. Some of these may be removed in the future if unneeded. Changelog updated accordingly. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2838 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Additional mapping fixes for engineering: http://www.kamletos.si/new%20engineering2.png - reverted change to smes having a separate area because: - - The SMES room does not and should not have it's own area because it is a part of engineering, APC's are too easy to fuck up, there are just no users of electricity in there, because the area is set to not require power and is permanently lit. - Fixed up the floors where they weren't aligned - Placed the spotlights inside the engienering area so they light up - Added some lattice to the east side of engineering and connected the oddly placed lattice on the west. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2830 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Soul Stones can now summon Shades. Soul Stones can now capture Shades (which heals them) Soul Stones capturing a soul will now be imprinted with that shade, and be unable to capture new souls/other shades Added ectoplasm object/sprites. As of now it has no uses. Shades now delete on death and leave ectoplasm behind. Soulstones can be bought with the wizards spellbook (as a set of six) and from the cultist supply talisman. The Chaplain has a single soulstone in his office (mostly for testing/so it will get used often and I can get feedback) Speaking of items on the map for testing, Reactive Teleport Armour no longer spawns in the RD's office (because Urist will murder me if I have to retarded test items out at once) Removed some no longer needed code regarding soulstones from the suicide verb.

 Added a mappable and admin spawnable set of beakers of each basic chemdispenser chemical that hold 1000 units and are the same functionally as 50 unit beakers. Please consult me if modding this to keep a proper format and organization. DISCLAIMER: I make no guarantees that these will work without problems (or even crashing the server). There are several issues with machines due to sanity checks assuming only 100 units is the max a beaker can hold. These are for testing purposes. Use at your own risk. I plan to include every reagent in the game eventually as well as standard 50 unit beakers for non-testing use. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2817 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Simple mobs can now attack humans (and you are able to set the attack messages and min/max damage of the attack with vars) Simple mobs who attempt to attack and have a max damage of 0 (which is the default) will emote a friendly gesture towards the target, the default being "nuzzles" though also editable via vars. Added the Shade simple mob (and some temporary sprites) which is the first simple mob capable of attacking. It was mostly for test purposes, but will probably end up becoming a feature of soul stones later on. Note: Simple animals still cannot interact with other simple animals, critters, mechs, cyborgs, aliens, monkeys etc etc, only humans at this point. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2808 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Huge fukken commit. Very game-changing new feature has been added but it isn't actually available to players yet. Spess Networking Technology: ▪ The machines are located in Centcom near the cargo shuttle. ▪ A new admin debug verb "Change Radio Type". Using this will toggle between old (current) radio code and the new radio code. ADMINS: I recommend only doing this if Doohl (me) is around to take note of anything that happens. ▪ The whole thing works, in theory, but hasn't been stress-tested with the usual 60+ players. I will write up a Tgstation Wiki article and/or explain what some of the stuff does in IRC or ingame. One last thing to point out: this is a PROTOTYPE. I have tested it myself and optimized the code very well. In theory, this new radio system is significantly less laggy AND has many more features. However, because of it's a prototype, it can at any time destroy the server. The reason I am committing this and not updating the changelog is because it's not an actual feature YET. I want to stress test this on the servers to see how it fairs, then add some more stuff to it like the ability to link machines and repair networks. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2807 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Finally ready to like add this now oh man this is a huge thing sort of Added CC-Nanotrasen, an IRC bot made by Skibiliano and given to us by him under CC-BY-SA 3.0 licensing WHAT DOES THIS MEAN? It means all servers running this SVN now have the option to use an easy to configure IRC bot capable of relaying adminhelps from ingame to the server/channel of their choice. - Runs on python 2.6 scripts with psyco support - Relaying can be toggled from config.txt (so you don't runtime with every adminhelp if you decide not to use it) - Comes with a bunch of other useful and fun tools too - Added a new global proc, send2irc(msg,msg2) YOU'LL NEVER GUESS WHAT IT DOES CONSIDERING WHAT I JUST MENTIONED ----msg and msg2 are just what text gets relayed to irc, separated by a |, for instance send2irc(hello, world) would come out as "CC_NanoTrasen: Hello | World git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2783 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Meat will now spoil within three minutes at temperatures between 0C and 100C. Rotten meat has the same nutritional value as normal meat, and can be used in the same recipes. However, it is toxic, and ingesting a badly-prepared big bite burger can kill you. Because refrigeration serves a purpose now, the kitchen cold room freezing unit is turned off by default.

 - Simple event dispatch system. - atom.forceMove() proc. Ignores density and other Move() restrictions, but calls Exited() and Entered() - var/emagged moved to /obj/machinery class - anyprob() helper proc. - Mecha internal damage vars encapsulated. - Mech Fabricators now require robotics ID to operate. Emag removes this restriction. - Added Odysseus Medical Exosuit and it's parts. Has integrated Medical Hud and ability to mount medical modules. - Added Sleeper Medical module for medical exosuits. Similar to common sleepers, but no ability to inject reagents. - Added Cable Layer module for exosuits. Load with cable (attack cable with it), activate, walk over dismantled floor. - Added another exosuit internal damage type - short circuit. Short-circuited exosuits will drain powercell charge and power relay won't work. - You should be able to send messages to exosuit operators using Exosuit Control Console - Gygax armour and module capacity nerfed. - Exosuit weapon recharge time raised. - Bugfix: EMP actually drains exosuit cell and damages it git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2780 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Added the Soul Stone Shard. tl;dr it functions like an intellicard for dead or dying humans. It will only work on a human if they are in crit/dead, if they actually have a player in them (so corpses where people have ghosted are immune) and if the soul stone shard is empty. Right now you can't do anything them other than capture people (and talk to them if you're near the stone) Added a new belt variety that can only hold shards. Still needs its own sprites.

 Kitchen cold room is now cooled by a freezing unit. Temperature is about 240K by default, but can be raised to room temperature or lowered to lethal coldness.

Put an Ion Rifle on the nuke ops shuttle which will hopefully help with nuke teams getting routinely destroyed by sec borgs.

Two reasons: - The recharge station is a bit of an easter egg. - You should NEVER place doors at the end of long hallways, as it makes people running through them constantly bump them open. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2732 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 added a proc for feedback feedback_add_details(var/variable,var/details) This adds the contents of the details variable at the end of the variable, which is defined in the variable variable. You know this last line makes perfect sense. It also adds a space between what is already in details and what you're adding. in effect it's a s += " content" Added an autogibber. If you bump into it from the right end, it gibs you.

 Huge disposals update- most of the station has been repiped. Engineering and atmospherics now have disposals. Mail delivery via disposals should now go to the correct locations.

 Added Reactive Teleport armour and on/off sprites for the armour. Click in hand to toggle on/off (like a cloaking device). When worn and activated, successfully blocked attacks will cause the wearer to warp randomly up to 8 tiles. EMPs will disable it. Values may need tweaking to balance the armour. One set now spawns in the RD's office to it will get used/tested, depending on how that goes I may move it to being produceable by the protolathe only, or remove it entirely etc Removed more X-Com shit I managed to fail to remove because of silliness with updating before committing restoring the file I meant to delete.

 Hopefully made meteor mode more deadly. Fixed meteor spawning so all the meteors that are set to spawn actually hit, but noticed that 50 meteors every 5 seconds proved itself to be way too laggy when all of them actually spawned properly and aren't deleted at soon as they're created due to being on the map's edge. Instead I lowered it to 6 per second. Wrote this in the changelog. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2679 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 AIs now actually use power from APCs, rather than simply require that equipment power is active. Malf overhaul, take two! Waaaay back in the old days, I made it so malf AIs had to hack APCs to win, instead of just sit AFK for 45 minutes. Now I'm taking some more drastic action, to see what happens. THE MALF AI NO LONGER SPAWNS ON THE AI SAT. Instead of sitting in the AI sat hoping nobody notices your blatantly obvious hacking, at which point the 3 people lucky enough to have looted EVA get to have all the fun, you can now shunt your core processes into an APC you have hacked, and hacked APCs are only moderately obvious. While shunted into an APC, the AI draws power from that APC instead of the one in their main core. If the APC loses power, the AI loses power as normal. If the APC they are in is damaged or destroyed, they are forced back into their main core. If the main core is inoperative at that time, they die. The AI is also capable of willingly going back to their main core. As long as the AI's main core is intact, the AI speaks out of its core, regardless of its current location. I have tested as much of this as I could to make sure it is functional, but thanks to the game mode overhaul, I have been unable to run actual malf rounds on my test server, so I have had to cheat and set things to work in any mode for testing. As for actual round balance, there's no real way to predict how that shit'll change. This is just the base overhaul, more changes will be forthcoming as malf rounds provide data on how the change performs. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2668 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Escape pods added to test out the concept. Before you read on this revision is more of a thing being tested than a feature that is guaranteed to stay. 4 escape pods have been added to the station, 2 at arrivals, 1 in engineering and one in security. Each pod is 4x3 tiles in size with a window tile, 2 chairs and a door. So it has 3 floor tiles to stand on. Pods don't have any sort of emagging capabilities, hijacking a pod does not count as completing the escape alone objective, surviving in a pod however counts towards the escape alive objective. Cult members in pods do not count towards the acolyte victory. Changelog updated with listed changes. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2663 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Small changes and bugfixes: ◦ Metroids can now be observed by ghosts. ◦ Saved User Interface preferences ("Old UI" & "New UI") now correctly get transferred to clones. ◦ Captain announcements now require the player to be next to the console. (Issue 220) ◦ Radio headsets no longer sometimes fail to deliver the messages (Issue 221) ◦ Some other insignificant back-end shenanigans. ◦ The pregame lobby now has title music. The gameticker chooses between two .ogg files on game start and plays that for everyone who joins. The music stops when create_character() gets called though. ◦ Gave some critters, namely "creature" and "blob" some attack sounds. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2655 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 (forgot one file, but also sending the log from the previous commit) Command intercept will now only increase the security level if it's lower than blue Added a keycard authentication device. When you interact with it it asks you which event you'd like to trigger, currently only "Red alert". When you select the event, it asks you to swipe your ID card. If you have the new keycard auth access (60) on it (all heads of staff do), it will trigger all other devices of the same type to flash for 2 seconds. If someone with the same access level on their card swipes their card on another device during this period, the event will happen. The idea behind this is the two key idea from submarine movies - just with ID cards. Admins are informed who requests the event and who triggers it btw, so abusing this is a bad idea. Added this to the changelog. Hopefully the dme will work properly this time. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2635 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Some minor mapping tweaks: - Maintenance tunnels are not meant to be super bright. On the contrary, they're supposed to be very, very dark. The few lights that there are are only to light up supplies or areas where doors don't line up in the mist logical way. Maintenance is a place to hide in or travel undetected, not be illuminated from everywhere. - Removed the fusion engine construction site from Engineering, that thing was never going to be built anyway - Finally, FINALLY, fixed the really awkward right-side construction door that led right into space. It is now the same access as the singularity external doors and there are two - It's an external airlock, basically. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2617 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Reinforced metal renamed to steel, since that what it now is. Steel floor tile renamed to metal floor tile to avoid confusion before it even happens Grass plants in hydro will now actually make grass floor tiles instead of really awkward patches You can no longer make steel via autolathe, you can however make metal, and inserting r-metal will still give you metal for use in the lathe Added 10 sheets of steel to EVA and 10 units of steel to engineering git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2604 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 It is no longer possible to make reinforced metal from metal sheets or vice versa. The reason for this is on Pete's side. The intention is to make RCD's not able to take down r-walls, however at the same time make r-walls harder to make. The way you make reinforced metal now is by using the mining processing unit. The recipe is a combination of metal and plasma ore. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2601 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 ◦ When equipping corgis with objects, their icons immediately update. Fixes a bit of visual lag. ◦ The kitchen and booze vending machines have some changed commodity values. Most importantly, kitchen has more eating utensils and trays. ◦ Changed the afterattack() and DblClick() to have the (location,control,params) parameters. ◦ Added a new radio filter, "RADIO_MAGNETS". ◦ Mucked around with /datum/signal. Just an extra variable and another comment. ◦ Guns' afterattack() proc now carries location,control,params. ◦ Projectiles now track exactly where the player clicked on a tile. Pretty neat, huh? New stuff: ◦ A new machine has been added: magnetic generators. They fit under floor tiles and can create dyanmic magnetic fields by directing ionized proton/electron beams to another tile. ◦ Another machine/computer was added that can control these magnetic generators. These machines come with their own pseudo-scripting engine for directing the magnetic beams magnetic modules create. They're not really complete yet, but they work for the firing range. I plan on expanding on this maybe sometime in the future, creating more applications for magnets elsewhere. ◦ Firing range things have been added, including target stakes and targets (both sprited by Veyveyr). You can mount targets onto target stakes and shoot them. Pixel-precision aiming has been applied to the targets (ONLY THE TARGETS!) so that you can see where you shot it and whatnot. You can literally blow holes through the targets until they collapse on themselves. ◦ Added a small little manual to the firing range on how to use the new stuff. It hopefully isn't too complicated to use. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2543 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Added the pirate captain stuff for HG Changelings can now regen from death Loyalty implants are now orderable from QM Repair bot is now adminspawn only Added the mech ion cannon, which is adminspawn for now Tweaked highlander a bit Updated the changelog git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2499 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Several map changes: fixed the disposal in the incinerator not leading to space. restocked the chem closet- it now contains an anaesthetic closet, which might be interesting. removed the glass windows from the front of the QM desk. possibly a few other changes, nothing significant though. Added the firing range, courtesy of vey. Don't get too excited, it's still under construction. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2498 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 TGSTATION MAP - Removed an extra light switch from the QM office, it now only has one. - Moved the QM office APC out of the window and onto a wall. - Fixed some broken pipes around Medbay. - Switched some odd grey manifold pipes to their proper colour coded ones. UTERUS MAP - Started mapping the Atmos pipes! Specifically the Air-Distro pipes! git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2497 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Beepsky was freaking out that his target got away (vanished) and almost crashed the server, this has been fixed. Fixed a few other runtimes. Space movement should be working slightly better. Projectile weapons now give a X has fired Y message, this might get removed in the near future depending on how spammy it ends up being. Projectiles now give a X has been hit by Y rather than a X has been shot by Y because knowing who shot you when you could not see them was rather silly. Securitrons will no longer scan for weapons when they are set to not scan for weapon auth, they also will nolonger ignore arrest status if set to check for weapon auth and the guy has it. Shotguns are nolonger on the Securitron's ignore list if weapon auth is on while all melee class weapons like eswords and batons are now on the list. The incinerator disposal is part of the station loop. A window has been added to the north side of tool storage. Emergency Storage now has the proper access. Disposal's mass driver control will no longer fire tox's mass driver. Removed a few old grey pipes in the courtroom. Toxins test chamber once again has a teleportation beacon. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2495 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Some remapping of the interrogation room and the brig. See the screenshot: http://www.kamletos.si/introom.png In addition to the changes that you can see in the screenshot I also replaced the two regular walls on the south side of the small atmos room with r-walls. So this brig weak spot is now closed. It had too many weak spots anyway. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2494 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Timers will no longer go off when you set them to 0 unless they are on. Unsimulated turfs can be climbed on once more. Small blobs can use the blob to move around in space. Jetpacks now have a toggle for the stabilization. Jetpack fuel use has been reset to .01. Moved most of the tanks over to a new folder and files so they are not all crammed into one. The meteor event actually spawns more than one wave worth of meteors. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2488 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Anything that used the updateappearance proc will no longer update hair/beards. The things that use it are DNA changes, Cloned mobs, Changlings. The proc was runtiming due code on lines 234 and 246, I looked into it a bit but don't currently know how to fix it. The proc is currently commented out so at least the skin color/body updates properly. Thanks to Exadv1 the reagent checking code for chem got a nice performance tweak. Minor text change to the steal ai objective. Few runtimes/nullchecks fixed. HoS does not spawn with a flash, Warden does not spawn with a taser, Security officers now spawn with a flash. Wizarditis has been uncommented and nerffed quite a bit. Moved most of the suits over to the clothing module folder. Force 0 items won't damage humans. The two lockboxes have been readded to the armory. The brigs extra large power cell has been cut in half. (still twice as large as normal apcs) git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2480 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Fixed a small bug with meteors. Adjusted the interrogation room. The intercoms start set up properly now. Fixed some areas. Guest commit by Blaank: Corrected firelock position of medbay front desk.

 MAPPERS, TAKE NOTE Improved my access change from last commit. In addition to req_access_txt, there is now req_one_access_txt. As long as an ID has at least one access from the new list, it is able to open the airlock (assuming any access in the other list is also satisfied). So, for instance, if you left req_access_txt blank, and put access_honk and access_silent into req_one_access_txt, the mime AND the clown would be able to open the airlock. Fixed the advanced energy gun checking for failure constantly instead of only when recharging, and thus breaking stupidly quickly. Stop breaking my stuff, other coders. >:C git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2473 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 - Added atom/proc/search_contents_for. Recursively searches through all contents of all atoms inside specified one for matches, returns a list of found atoms. - Added teleporter datum. do_teleport proc is now just a wrapper for it. - Added damage absorption to mechs. - Added mecha step and turn sounds. - Cleaned effects code a bit. - Metal foam should now block air movement. - Since sd_ lightning library chops areas into pieces, turrets now work with master area. - Tried to optimize DesignHasReqs proc. - Added plasma converter and laser cannon mecha equipment. - Other cosmetic changes. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2463 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 You can now store C4 in whatever, without blowing yourself up. Changed the armoury layout a bit, Sec got two more riot suits, and lost two empty lockboxes. Changed the medical room in Sec to an interrogation room! Credit to Smoke Carter for the design. As a result, Mr Fixit has been powered off and returned to the armoury. Deploying him every round is likely to be a good idea. Feedback is always welcome, especially from Sec Officers. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2462 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Update to feedback gathering: - Rounds that end in invalid ways will now be logged, - Round results are logged - Rounds that don't end with a code-determined reboot will still not log at all (so rounds that end in a crash will not log at all - not even round start or mode.) git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2457 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 - More work on the new click proc. Added a 1s delay for all hand interactions: - Added an exception for the application of a delay when you're targeting an item that you are holding. So there is only a 100ms delay when putting items in your backpack, taking them out, juggling stuff in your inventory, etc. It was about 1s before. So the delays between uses are now: - When targeting items that you aren't holding: - - items with USEDELAY: 2s delay - - items with NODELAY: 0.1s delay - - items with neither: 1s delay - When targeting items that you are holding - - all items: 0.1s delay There is one more problem with pathfinding where windows don't properly block clicking. This is the last thing that needs to be addressed, then it should finally be ready. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2446 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Hair and Facial Hair Overhaul: ○ Hairs are now defined in /datum classes located in the new file sprite_accessories.dm. Further explanation and documentation can be located in this file. ○ As a result of the above change, some new_player preferences code had be reworked. Savefile versions have also been updated, and a small conversion proc has been placed to prevent file corruption and mis-matched variable data. ○ The final result of all of these changes is a simpler, pain-free way to add in new hairs. It also makes the code much more readable. Other stuff: ○ Three new hairstyles (mostly female), one new beard. ○ Updated the changelog. Final bugfixes: ○ Fixed xray superpower preventing you from using any kind of HUD eyewear. ○ You can no longer strangle metroids - instead, attempting to strangle them will result in you "squeezing" them. The new hair system, while thoroughly tested by myself, is very prone to bugs given its very prototype state. Any bugs are to be reported via Issues. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2444 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Stunglove overhaul: part one. Stun gloves are now made by wiring a pair of gloves, and then attaching a battery- this shows up on the object sprite, but not on your character. Stungloves use 2500 charge per stun! This means that some low capacity batteries will make useless stungloves. To get your old inconspicous gloves back, simply cut away the wire and battery. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2439 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 New WIP TK system added. To activate your TK click the throw button with an empty hand. This will bring up a tkgrab item. Click on a non-anchored (currently) non mob Object to select it as your "focus". Once a focus is selected so long as you are in range of the focus you can now click somewhere to throw the focus at the target. To quit using TK just drop the tkgrab item. The captains laser, aegun, and xbow recharge a bit slower now, they recharged so fast that you almost never had to stop shooting. Cleaned up the cyborg_modules file Medical and Security borgs have a hud item. Medical bots bottles hold 60 of their chemical (up from 30). Medical bots now have three syringes that are labeled "Syringe-(Inaprovaline)", "Syringe-(Anti-Toxin)", and "Syringe-(Mixed)". Medical bots now have two kelotane/dexalin pills (up from 1/ea). Engineering bots got a new RCD thats just like the old one but the code is cleaner and meant for borgs only. Husks brains can no longer be cut out. Healing hands code has been removed till whoever wants to finish it adds it to a place that is NOT the base click procs. Added veyveyr's nuke team weapon. Its more or less the Uzi with a new icon.

Added a config option for the jobs to be loaded from the jobs.txt rather than use the defaults. Loyalty implanter removed. The Limplanter was designed to be on the prison station as it took more time and was a pain to get people up there to implant them. No prison station, no Limplanter.

Brig lockers are now anchored to the inside of the cells and once again have their IDs set. Warden's locker moved to his office. Cell controls Names/IDs/Access fixed as well as once again working with the brig lockers. Removed a few of the blast doors from the inside of the brig.

 Old keyboard hotkey layout option available again! home, end, page down and page up now once again do what they did before by default. To use diagonal movement you will need to use your numpad with NUM LOCK enabled. The new list of hotkeys is as follows: (Valid as of 21.10.2011) Numpad with Num Lock enabled = movement in wanted direction. Numpad with Num Lock disabled = as it was before. movement north-south-east-west and throw, drop, swap hands, use item on itself. Page up (also numpad 9 with num lock disabled) = swap hands Page down (also numpad 3 with num lock disabled) = drop home (also numpad 7 with num lock disabled) = throw end (also numpad 1 with num lock disabled) = use item in hand on itself CTRL + A = throw CTRL + S = swap hands CTRL + D = drop CTRL + W = use item in hand on itself Numpad divide (/) = throw Numpad multiply (*) = swap hands Numpad subtract (-) = drop Numpad add (+) = use item in hand on itself In short, use Num Lock to swap between the two layouts.

 Committing Uristqwerty's AI freelook. Thank you! The extent of my implementation of this involves commenting out some multi z-level specific stuff, and adding a dmi of the overlays it uses. This currently causes runtime errors due to my lazy implementation! Only -you- can fix them. http://pastebin.com/AqU8sA4b So far as I can tell, it just needs some sanity checks. I would leave this unchecked until the runtimes are fixed. Additionally, our map doesn't actually fair too badly with proper camera LOS, but there are a couple of areas that need improvement.

 When you're unconscious you will get the same blackness as always, but every 25 seconds, the alpha channel of it will reduce by about 30% for 0.3 seconds. So... 25s blackness, 0.1s 15% transparent, 0.1s 30% transparent, 0.1s 15% transparent, repeat.

 Bugfixes: ◦ Some head gear (nurse masks, kitty ears...) no longer block CPR. (Issue 167) ◦ DNA Scanners no longer attempt to empty their contents whenever something enters them. This fixes the issue with constructed scanners puking out the circuitry they were made with. (Issue 169) ◦ You can longer /me emote when you've been paralyzed by Zombie Powder. (Issue 168) ◦ Fixed some problems with MMIs / Robots / pAIs being able to understand eachother. ◦ You can put items, that are not clothing/under or clothing/suit, on food trays. How it works is it loops through all acceptable items in the location and adds them to its overlays and a special list variable. I had to change the way mob/drop_item() works a bit. Trays have a maximum capacity, and items of a larger w_class take up more capacity. ◦ Slippery items like banana peels and soap have been nerfed significantly. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2335 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Organs: Moved into their own folder and got split into three files. Damage zones have been regrouped slightly to make it easier to deal with them. Currently the organ groups are head, l/r leg, l/r arm, and head. Attacking: Armor is properly checked. Currently aiming for the chest gives a higher chance to stun whereas the head will stun for longer. Stungloves/Disarm now show up in the attack log. Stungloves ignore intent. Silicon: AI units can now move between cams that are not on the ss13 network. Cyborg's alert screen should not longer pop up every time they get an alert if they have opened it once during the round. Robot vision now uses the standard amount of energy. Gamemodes: Added Deuryn's unrev message. Runes can only be examined if you are close to them. Moved the Loyalty implants to the HoS' locker at the request of HerpA. Nuke agents now come with explosive implants that will activate upon death. Projectiles: Once again went though the gun code and cleaned things up, it is much better now. Bullet_act fixed up and most mobs now use the one in living, just overload it if they need to do something diff. Freeze /caplaser/xbow no longer have an infinite loop. Shotguns have to be pumped manually. Went though the latest runtime log. Power cells now use return on their give/use procs Assemblies have been reworked and are nearly finished, just need to finish up the special assembly code, redo the signalers, and add one or two new assembly items. Laying down will now only take 3 ticks to get up, from 5. You can no longer punch people on the spawn screen. This is a big one and was cleared by two heads, TK will only allow you to pick up items. If you have an item in your hand it will act normal. This revision got much larger than originally intended my tests show everything is working fine, but you never know. Ill likely do more mob teaks in the next few days. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2333 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Fixed the map/code issues that the body bags caused. /obj/effects is now /obj/effect. /obj/station_objects is now /obj/structure. Did a bit of minor blob work. The Bay 12 body bags were replaced with closets because having two sets of code that do almost the same thing is silly. Changed back a few of the last jobproc edits as the remove from list before assign was a check to see if the mob was fucked up and if it was remove it so we did not check it again as it would still be fucked up. The medbay/tox monkeys names are random once more.

 - "delete all of type" added to the view variables panel. It requires you to first select whether you want to delete all objects of the strict type or of the type and all subtypes. After this you need to confirm. And then you need to confirm again. If anyone manages to get through 3 confirmation screens 'by accident' they are lying. You can only use 'delete all of type' for objects (of type /obj) git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2265 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 - New click proc now uses the following delays for clicking. This means that you are unable to click anywhere until the delay time has passed. - attackby uses a 1s delay, - attack_hand and varieties and attack_self use a 0.2 second delay, - clicking the HUD has a 0.2 second delay, Items with the USEDELAY flag set the attackby delay to 2s. Items with the NODELAY flag set the attackby delay to 0.2s. Items without either of the two flags (most) use the standard 1s delay. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2262 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Moved around some stuff in R&D. (Change by Blaank) Donut boxes and paper bins are now put immediately in your hand to prevent weird shit from happening when you're holding them in your hand or a backpack.

 - Moved another proc from datums/disease.dm to mob.dm so doubleclicking /mob actually gets you to the mob's definition. - Two new admin verbs. "toggle hear radio" and "toggle hear deadcast". These don't care if you're a ghost or what you had for breakfast, they work because they're tied to your client, not your mob. To non-admins it might seem silly that this is needed but when dealing with multiple adminhelps you don't want text to move at lightning speed, so anything that you can disable is good. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2259 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Elite Rig, sprite by TankNut. They are about as protective as a red suit, with a bit better bio protection. I noticed the RIG's Helmets didn't have their radiation variable anymore!

 - Made a beta version of the new DblClick() proc. As per my testing it is far more efficient than the old one. The click-proc is ready for ingame testing. To initiate a test, use the "Toggle NewClickProc" verb if you're a game admin or game master. - The following procs have been added: ismetroid() ispAI() - Using the new click proc adds support for the following new procs: attack_robot(), attack_ghost(), attack_admin(), hanr_r(), hand_m() Proc description: - attack_robot() is the proc that gets called when a cyborg clicks on any atom without having a module selected. It defaults to attack_ai() and for the moment always calls the default as there is no separation. - attack_ghost() is the proc that gets called when a ghost clicks on any atom. It defaults to examine() - attack_admin() is the proc that gets called when a ghost with admin status clicks on any atom. It defaults to attack_ghost() - hand_r() is the proc that gets called when a restrained cyborg clicks on any atom. It defaults to hand_a(), which is the the proc for a restrained AI, whatever that means. - hand_m() is for when a restrained metroid clicks on an item. Please note that the new click proc drops support for the HEAL mutation. Let me know if this mutation is important. All I can tell you is that it doesn't belong in this proc. - Moved the mob/Delete() proc to mob.dm. Doubleclicking /mob in the object tree will now throw you to mob.dm instead of some random datumvars.dm. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2256 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Added Derp's jump_to_dead_group proc. Uncommented out the warn verb. Derelict areas consolidated a bit to remove some of the APCs. Cut around 30 air groups including 3 that would go inactive shortly after round start. Prison station started as a simple pipe remap because the pipes were so messy in there and ended with an overhaul. Altogether the pstation is slightly smaller. Observation room replaced with more windows and a few space tiles to make people actually have to work to break out without tools. Most of the interior R-walls replaced with normal walls. Pstation shuttle width increased by 1 tile granting 3 more tiles to stand in. Vending machine placed inside the prisoner room so they can eat if needed. Cells interior doors removed to cut down on the number of vents needed, if you want to lock them in just shut the firelock and weld that. Pstation solars shrunk slightly and don't fully block access to the back of the pstation. It likely still needs a few tweaks and I might redo the pipes again later. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2254 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 - Baby steps in rewriting the DblClick() proc. Will work on it later. - Removed all effect of wizarditis. The disease still exists but has absolutely no effect on anything. And no, this is not a removal only from the game world, it's a removal, period. Admins don't have it either. As I said however, the disease exists so you might see wizarditis as a diagnosis on your medical scanner, it won't have any effect tho. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2252 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 This commit adds nothing new to the game whatsoever, the only thing it contains is comments about how the DblClick() proc works. It took me a few hours to decipher it, so hopefully the comments will save you some time. DblClick() is the proc which determines what proc will be called when you click on the screen. (Single clicking also calls this proc btw, in case you're confused.) So DblClick() is the proc which then calls attack_hand(), attack_ai(), attack_paw(), attackby(), afterattack() and the hand_h(), hand_ai() and simmilar proc for when you're restrained. In case you noticed one common proc missing, attack() is called in a mob's attackby() proc, which originates from here. So the cascade for that is Click() > DblClick() > attackby() > attack() git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2251 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

Spawn the spacevine_controller to start the spreading of kudzu Screenshot: http://www.kamletos.si/kudzu2.png (This was after 15 minutes of unattended growth.) git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2226 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 - You can now recolor jumpsuits, shoes, gloves and bedsheets using the washing machine. Screenshot: http://www.kamletos.si/laundry.png - Some religions (currently Islam, Scientology and Atheism) set your chapel's symbols to the symbols of that religion. Screenshot: http://www.kamletos.si/view%20variables%206.JPG (The tiles) - Detective now has his stuff in an old-styled cabinet. (Sprite by Hempuli) - Got rid of some.. uhh... Runtime errors... and... uhh... A certain dungeon master... I... I WAS ORDERED TO DO IT, YELL AT URIST AND CREED! - I doubt you'll get this far in reading this changelog due to the previous point, but just in case you do... Admin tools updated: - View variables now has a "Mark Object" option. After you've marked an object or datum, you will be able to assign the value to a variable. An example would be if you try to put an item into a closet. You'd open view variables on the item you want to move, select "mark object", open 'view variables' of the closet, click E or C next to contents and select "marked datum (type)". After this, you select 'No' for the reference question. Screenshot: http://www.kamletos.si/references.jpg - Also in View variables, you can now access a player's 'Player panel' if you view a mob's variables. - Updated changelog with these changes git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2225 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Tweaked metroids a bit and fixed some bugs. Most noteably, Metroids could still evolve/reproduce if they were dead. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2224 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Fixed a couple missing atmos pipes near the theatre. Changed the kitchen slightly so that people in the maintenance hallway north of it can no longer use the Smartfridge. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2223 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Changed the name of the engineering emergency oxygen tank. Changed the name on the purple goggles. Names in all caps are bad. Fixed a minor instance of a piece of lattice over top of a disposal pipe in space. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2222 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Reduced the number of loose monkey cubes in Xenobio. Aft Starboard Solars/Maint remap, the solars are now standard. Slight Virology remap. Reduced number of costumes in the theatre, fixed piping bug. Changed up a couple of disposal pipes to run through Maint. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2221 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Projectiles cleaned up a bit and moved into a /modules folder. Solars should work a bit better now. Removed the old shield item as it has not been used in forever and was cluttering up some of the mob code. IonRifle only has 5 shots before it needs to be reloaded down from 10. Lowered the weakbullet's stun to match the taser. You can no longer recall the shuttle on meteor. Fixed a bug I caused on rev where if the revs were in space and dead it would count them as living. Bit of blob work. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2220 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Added purple goggles for Lasty (and put two pairs in chemistry) Added a third MMI to robotics (they have six flashes after all) Added monkey cubes to xenobio git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2219 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Le me e'squashing-a bugs. Mech Fabricators: - They were generating an absolutely ridiculous amount of runtime errors because, somehow, an /obj/screen object leaked its way into the part_sets (/list) variable. To stop this, I have changed a for() iterator to loop through a specific object type instead of general /atom-ic instances. Chemistry-Holder.dm: - Fixed an infinite-loop problem with "mixing" virii in reagent containers. I have removed a check that makes sure no two of the same virus exists in the same container because it's entirely unnecessary. The same virus cannot infect a mob more than once, so having multiple virus instances is not at all harmful. - This should hopefully fix some very serious that lag nearly crashes the server. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2218 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 You can now attach a string to coins using cable coil (remove with wirecutters). With a string attached you have a chance to recover the coin when buying an item from a vending machine that requires a coin. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2212 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Fixed metroid behavior code so that it's now possible to "tame" Metroids by simply feeding them a lot. This should cut down on the massive xenobio Metroid rampages, and make traitor-ranching metroids more worth it. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2210 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 You can now insert a coin into a vending machine. Some (currently only cigarette machine) have special items which you can only get to with a coin. No, hacking will not allow you to get to these items. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2209 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Fixed cyborg rev heads counting as living and still being able to flash people. Normal revs that get borged will be unrev'd. Added a cooldown to the captains message system. Cleaned up the Coms computer slightly. Fixed a few runtimes. More blob work. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2207 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Cleaned up the sleeper code a bit. Monkey boxes lowered to 2 monkeys per box and the crate now costs net 15 points for one box. They were also removed from vending machines. I warned that they would be changed if people continued to spam them. Windows and disposal pipes layers adjusted slightly. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2204 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 - Fixed bug where putting someone in a sleeper didn't set it as occupied, allowing others to climb in which would destroy the mob already inside. - Fixed bug where players who hadn't entered the game could hear dsay - Runtime! now runs times. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2203 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 I know we should have had this forever but we didn't... Banning, unbanning and editing bans (both the regular and job flavored) is now logged into a separate file. (data/ban_unban_log.txt) Also removed two unused variables from Runtime the cat. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2202 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Made new sprites for light tube and glasses boxes. (Bulb boxes only have bulbs in them, tube boxes only have tubes.) Removed some awful descriptions from items which should not have descriptions. See: paper, empty boxes. Fixed a bug which would cause traitor packs to have an emergency O2 tank and breath mask in them. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2201 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Fixed a bug with the e-sword deflection messages. Added an ion cannon for mechs, thus far is adminspawn only and still needs a sprite. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2200 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Singularity absorption explosion range lowered and is now dependent on singularity size. BoH is no longer an instakill on a singularity, the chance the singularity will die from bombs now 25% from 10%. Finished removing Metabslow from the game because delaying Interface rebuilds is a bad idea. Sadly THE SUN is gone due to lighting lag issues, the current mob max luminosity is set to 7. Damage and stun from doors shocking people has been lowered. process() is now an obj level proc as it was already used by several procs and they can now jump onto the ticker if needed. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2199 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 - Did some more soundwork, blah blah. - Radio headsets now display the command for their channel on examine to helpfully cut down on "HOW DO I TALK TO X" questions. - Added Runtime as a cat for the CMO due to popular demand, though he doesn't actually spawn yet as he doesn't have a proper sprite. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2197 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Critters: Made carp actually hurt humans. Also, they can now sometimes knock you down when they attack you. Additionally, I added some new variables dictating attack speed and sound associated with attacking for critters. Carp now make bitey noises, rejoice! I also fixed some other miscallenous bugs with metroids attacking stuff. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2196 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Updated the uterus station: - Extended maintenance south of research to reach the escape arm: Screenshot: http://www.kamletos.si/toxins%20shooty%20thing.png - Connected atmos to the 7 atmos pipes via a new purple main air supply pipe. No vents should be directly connected to this pipe! - As mentioned, added a purple pipe color. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2193 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Fixed a few runtimes Blob mode updated slightly Wizard smoke from his smoke spell will partly block lasers that go through it. Going to try and test a diff way for the singularity to "del" items, might cause less lag, it will also eat absorb other singularities. RD lost tech storage access, see http://nanotrasen.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=5991 for details git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2192 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Committing the most recent version of uterus. Edits made to it from my part: - Added an atmos maintenance room to 7 locations: cargo, bridge, brig, medbay, science, engineering and kitchen When piping uterus, use these rooms, get a line from atmospherics to each of the 7 atmos maintenance rooms and then to local vents from the maintenance rooms. - http://www.kamletos.si/atmos1.JPG git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2191 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 - You can now cancel the 'Declare ready' thing - When you hit 'Declare ready' it no longer asks you for confirmation, as you can cancel it just as easily.

 E-Swords now have a chance to deflect projectiles when active. Added missing sprites for the ion rifle charges, and ion rifle on back sprites. I still cannot into changelog git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2188 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Right. First commit. Probably will break the entire game forever. Replaced the too-large grape seeds sprite with ones more in line with the other seed sprites. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2187 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 View variables now has a search function which searches through the lines listed below. I think this was the last feature that was missing. For example, instead of selecting 'Edit variables' and hitting the c key a few times to get to ckey, you now select 'View variables' and write ckey. Screenshot: http://www.kamletos.si/view%20vars5.JPG git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2186 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 The safe plasma limit on breathing has been lowered causing plasma to actually damage you at a semi decent rate. The force secret mode will now build the list of possible modes and make sure it can set the forced mode up before it actually picks the mode. If the setup fails it will just use another mode from the secret list. The R-table in medbay lobby was replaced with a normal table and medbay mostly follows the old "Can you get to the hall with next to nothing on you" map design. Blob mode work. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2185 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 - Ian now chases food and eats it if he can. - isanimal() and iscorgi() procs have been added - attack_animal() added for all atoms, called when an animal attacks (clicks on) an object within range. - attack_animal() proc added to food. Simple animals don't process reagents, meaning they can eat anything whatsoever. Corgis can take 5 bites out of any type of food. Ian will chase the food himself, regular corgis won't due to lag concerns. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2183 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 New admin feature: under the "Game Panel" verb, if the current mode is secret (or if you change it to secret) a new selection will appear underneath the Change Gamemode selection that allows you to "force" secret to be a certain game mode. This is mostly for adminfuckery where they make it wizard every single time for 10 rounds and the game mode is still secret. Removed an unneeded metroid variable. Added some more arcade names. Fixed the grammars. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2182 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Admins now have a 'prayer visibility' verb, which allows us to toggle whether prayers are displayed to us or not. In addition only trial admin and higher can now see prayers. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2181 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 - Dead simple animals now have a density of 0, so they can be walked over - simple animals can now be healed by items in /obj/item/stack/medical (bruisepacks and ointment). The medical items that heal brute damage will heal the animals. They do nothing if the animal is dead - simple animals can now be hurt by attacking them with objects that do damage (toolboxes, etc.) git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2177 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Lawyer now has a purple suit and the job has two slots. Lowered the number of spare jumpsuits in most of the lockers from 6 to 3. The old arrival message is now back in. Finished the Ion Rifle and added one to the armory. Might need to change it up a bit depending on how well it works. Bullet_act worked on a bit, EMP effects should work now. Cyborgs are stunned by EMPs. Raised the changelings required genome number for multichan at the request of Urist. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2175 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Cyborgs: Tasers and lasers now drain twice as much battery per shot EMP bursts now do 60 damage to cyborgs as opposed to 25 Guns: Added the three Desert Eagles by Cheridan, none spawn on map currently Added the sprite for the Ion Rifle by Falazameer, but it does not have any EMP effect yet/the code is unfinished Wizard: Finally fixed it so the wizard gets Lasers/Hulk instead of Laser/TK git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2174 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Removed the spiderman costume from spawning in the theater because it doesn't have an item sprite. Please sprite an item sprite for them which is in-style with the other jumpsuits.

 Fix to the interface: - It no longer does the silly thing at startup: http://i.imgur.com/IA5t1.png - Removed browser's forward-back buttons, - Removed a ctrl+d thing that didn't work, git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2171 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Updated the interface a bit to allow a built-in browser. The upper right panel, where the verbs usually are now has two functions, verbs and the browser. This feature has been added to hopefully reduce the number or pop-ups that appear. Currently only request consoles and vending machines use this feature. I'll wait for feedback and then update the rest, if feedback is positive. Also removed the redcoat spawn pack... The redcoat suit is MINE. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2170 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Simple animals update (At the moment only effects the corgi ingame): - Hud removed from simple animals, so if you move from human to a simple animals, your HUD will properly update - Stat for dead and alive now properly updated - Fixed animals randomly leaving closed containers such as closets or the dna pod - Animals can now be buckled. They will not randomly move if bucked or if they have the resting variable set - Bumping follows the same rules as above, it should also now work properly - Harm intent message shown in red instead of blue git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2169 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Small fix for metroids. They would sometimes sit around not doing much for a short period of time, when they should be hunting for food. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2168 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 - Removed collectible hats from the theatre. - Added theatre vending machine sprites in preparation for a vending machine that will provide entertainment in exchange for space tickets. - Added a tounge sprite in preparation for tongues git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2167 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 When I add a new proc to my interface like things I need to remember to actually update the rest of them, also a few runtime fixes. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2166 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Simple animal code has been added in. This means that simple animal mobs that basically ignore what is going on can be added into the game rather quickly. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2165 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Added a rather crappy edit to the PA control box so it has directional sprites, would be nice if someone could finish spriting them. Synaptizine once again helps with stuns however it is slightly toxic to humans and might give you some toxloss every time it ticks to balance the unstun. Actually removed the logged say file this time. Cargo main now merged into one area as it's was literally the same room with two areas. Hydro East cam now is on the SS13 net and the prison station cam comp is actually on the prison station network. The table in sec lost its two lower parts allowing officers to actually walk around without pushing people. Added a wrench to the armory for the Warden's portable flashers. Medical maintenance doors access levels fixed. Medical is a bit less of a clusterfuck of pipes, I only did most of the west half and the tunnel. The east and tox still have to be done. Medical Hallway to foyer, internal medhallway, and cryo doors were removed with permission from the head coders. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2164 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Did a bit of work on assemblies. The rev icons bug might be fixed now. Removed the old logged say file as it is no longer used and contained questionable material. People should no longer spawn on the wizard station for a second at round start. Removed the old intercept vars as they have not been used in a good while. Blob is more or less back to its old state but still has the lava sprite, can we please get some new sprites for it.

 No more pAI recruit window spam. Added a toggle option to be a pAI (much like you can for aliens.) Changed popup window into an alert() and added a "never for this round" button in it.

 - Suicide is now visible on examine. Since I am terribad at coding, I made it so it checks for the suiciding var, which is usually reset once you finish dying to allow for suiciding again if you're cloned, but now it will instead reset when you are cloned. - Fixed a bug I made re: examining oxygen tanks. - Made chemsprayers large instead of small. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2155 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Delicious Nuka cola is back, with a bottled sprite for its glass (don't question why it turns a glass into a bottle and back again, it is just physics). Seriously don't remove ice cups from the booze O mat, it is meant to use a cheap Styrofoam cup as its sprite (that's the look I was going for when I made it, after all.. what else would you use?). Synaptizine is now useful. It reduces weakness/ stun/ silence/ drowsiness/ paralysis to zero. Meaning you can't be stunned, or knocked down for more than a moment. it is great for when a rogue borg rolls around or if you need to revive some one who was stunned by a shocked door (but not killed by it) or if you just need to get away from those dang security officers. It'll do more too, but it is pretty much anti-zombie powder (just it can't cancel the toxic effects of zombie powder). git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2143 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 New mapping verb. Count objects level and Count objects all. Allows you to enter a path and in the case of Count objects level also a z-level number. This proc will count the number of objects that there are on the level. The commands can be found in mapping debug, so it's game master only. The commands go to the top-level container (just below turf) to see what item you have. Unfortunately some coders (AGOURI!!) sometimes don't spawn items properly (SUIT STORAGE UNITS!!), making the items exist, but not on the actual z-level. They are not located in contents, nor do they have the loc variable set. The loc variable of them is null, yet they exist. Count objects all will find them while Count objects level won't. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2138 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 HoP finally gets some love update: ID computer got updated: - New interface - Clicking it with an ID card will now first check if the card has ID computer access, if it does it will place the card in the authentication slot. If the slot is full, or the card doesn't have ID comp access, it will place it in the slot for the ID to be modified. If both slots are full nothing will happen. - Removing an ID from the computer will now place it in your hand, if it's empty. - Added this to the changelog. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2130 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Set the hallway firedoors' dir to face the way they're facing. Hopefully this will make hallway airgroups smaller and thus cut down on atmos lag when the groups are broken.

 We decided to give R'n'D a table facing the hallway. Hopefully this will mean ordering stuff from r'n'd will be easier. To do the above, I swapped the location of gas storage and R'n'D. I admit R'n'D is not the prettiest of rooms but eeh, whatever. Now onto the stuff that'll get this rev downvoted, dispite me saying I want to keep them, people (the ones who have influence) wanted me to remove the pair of insulated gloves in research maintenance. I also removed the two fire suits, mesons and 4 of the 5 utility belts in the same hallway.

 Made the alien dinghy in the abandoned mining station an actual shuttle that can be moved via the secrets admin menu. Because it processes lighting, some lighting bugs will appear if you used it with light-emitting objects in it. I would care if this was more commonly used but since it's admin-only and in an obscure part of the map, I say whatever, it's not worth it as it won't affect anything anyway. The base which it leads to only has closets and beds in it. Perhaps some fun stuff will be added later. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2097 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Mapping changes! - The escape shuttle has been remapped to have a bigger interior space, more supplies, and cooler look. I took the best ideas and concepts from the forums and combined them into one. - Expanded the maintenance tunnels near the research division a bit. - Added more testing area camera displays in the testing observatory area. This lets more than 2 people view the cameras at once. - Added a few more AI hologram projectors to the station. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2095 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 My very own feedback gathering system! The blackbox can now gather feedback via the feedback_set(var_name,amt), feedback_inc(var_name,amt) and feedback_dec(var_name,amt) procs. The way feedback is gathered is that the three procs are placed in code where feedback is wanted, these in turn set variables in the blackbox (Yes, I could have done it in an out-of-world datum or object, but I just prefer having an actual physical object gather this stuff.) At the end of the round, all acquired data is saved to a database. I still need to get ahold of TLE to make the required tables and bugtest some things. The saving proc exsists, but is not yet called due to the lack for a table to save to. The rest of it should work fine tho, so you can place the feedbac_set, _inc and _dec procs around code and see what they provide via view variables, it just won't save it to the database yet. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2092 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Ninja suit non longer has slow down (WHY IS NINJA SLOW?!). Void suit has a slight reduction in their slow down (making their speed on par with syndicate suits). Rig suits are now more resistant to fire, and as the captain's armor's slowdown number. Meson scanners had a -2 modifier to dark vision, I don't know if it was on purpose or not, but I reset the night vision to a zero modifier (-2 means you can't even see what's on your own tile in the dark, 0 modifier means no change from normal human night vision). Santa suit no longer has a slow down, suit storage can carry everything. Not a big deal, but it is handy in sandbox mode (which I'm still working on, I'm just not good at making it less shit of a mode). git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2075 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 The modified Changeling mode should end properly now. Tracking implants can now be used to message the holder. Mini Readme update. Explosive implants will explode when the host dies.

 Fixed silicate: - You can no longer infinitely reinforce them, they have a limit. This should prevent them from becoming so reinforced that they become literally invisible. - You can now rotate silicated windows without the icon not updating properly. - Silicate now doesn't automatically double a window's integrity, instead, it now depends on the volume of silicate. This prevents windows from becoming virtually invincible. 1 unit of silicate is only 1/100ths as effective as 100 units of silicate, etc. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2072 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 - Adding some new chaplain-associated variables to the gameticker /datum. - Library computers will now universally tap into these variables and retrieve information to paste onto bibles when printing new ones. Also, they now have a one-minute cooldown when printing bibles. - An additional start-up prompt is given to the chaplains when they start. They can now select new bible icons (which can be immediately reversed and swapped with another icon if they don't like it) that have no real effect other than aesthetics. Thank you, Kor, for making these. - Tweaked Metroids so that they are slightly more aggressive, move slower when aggressive, and gain more nutrition from eating. They also become hungrier faster. - Adding a "recoil" variable to guns. No current guns use it yet, but if they did (through edit-variable) it would cause a player's screen to shake whenever they successfully fire a shot. Potential use for projectile firearms, especially shotguns. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2058 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

Also, bio suits protect against chemicals a lot better now. - You can now simply wear a gas mask (or internals with a breath mask) to be completely immune to smoke, provided that you're wearing a full bio suit. - Nerfed pacid and sulphuric acid a bit.

 - Chemistry smoke now is laced with everything inside of the beaker/container. Using a new smoke icon, the smoke will exhibit a color combination of the reagents just like normal, so you can easily identify a cloud of pacid smoke from dexalin smoke. (space drugs smoke, anyone?) - A new /datum/reagents proc called copy_to() works like trans_to() except that it "copies" reagents instead of transferring them. - Modified all breathing mobs to support inhaling chemical smoke reagents. If you are a-hatin', please leave all your hate in this revision page.

 Finally got around to working on that power armor overhaul I'd told myself I was gonna do. tl;dr is that instead of being a single object, power armor now has component objects, which determine how good it is at things. They are still a work in progress, lacking a way to actually construct them and such. That said, there are adminspawnable sets. One is more or less what the old power armor was, sans a runtime error that was causing it to be immune to everything, the other is an adminbus set that is genuinely immune to everything. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2023 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Bugfixes galore: - Retrovirus is now curable. However, unlike most viruses, when it infects a host it generates a random cure. This cure can be either Ryetalyn or rest. For good measure, a doctor should prescribe Ryetalyn AND send them to the recovery room for rest. - Fixed a crash in the seeds crate that would result in the crate only having berry seeds. A small typo. - Fixed some grammar. - Cloning people should now transfer their UI preferences onto the clones. - Portable Artificial Intelligences should now properly be able to use the messaging software. They generated some odd runtimes caused by normal PDAs not recognizing pAIs in the PDAs list. - Hopefully, I made equipping and dropping items a bit more responsive. - As a result of the fix above, the item duplication bug (two people pick an item up at the same time) should theoretically not happen anymore. When I mean theoretically, I mean I have no way of testing this for sure. - Cleaned up some of Deuryn's code in a previous revision. Miscellaneous: - The Cold can now be cured if you're just laying down, although actually sleeping will greatly increase your odds of curing it. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@2016 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Users could dupe diamonds. I fixed that. Insert rate was 3750 and eject rate was 1000. You could eject a sheet from a protolathe and get 3750 cm worth, but only 1000 cm worth was taken out of the machine. Repeat this and you can turn 1 sheet into 50 in no time. So BUGFIXED IT.

 Metroids: - Their AI has been fixed. Previously, when they began "starving" they would lock up when they located a target. This was because I was only allowing Metroids to attack people when they were only attacked themselves. - Small stun time added to wrestling Metroids off or beating them off with objects. - You should now not be able to enter mechas, cryos and sleepers if you have Metroid on your head. Cargo: - You can now cancel cargo orders. Miscellaneous: - Manifests no longer show "unassigned" for everyone on round start. - The manifest is updated realtime, in that when new arrivals arrive or a job is changed, the information gets passed onto the central database. - New arrivals now generate security records, medical records, etc. Jubilations! - I, perhaps, have increased the efficiency of the reaction system. Preliminary tests confirmed that it's slightly faster, but I worry about whether I may have ruined someone's vision of a perfect multiple reaction system. This "change" is nothing more than adding a break; line to the end of a loop. If this proves too buggy, I'll just revert it. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1952 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Bugfixes: Fixed a boatload of runtime errors. There's so many I just completely forgot what they all were! Explosions / Singularities now do not gib people "one-by-one" as some people may have noticed. This looked absolutely weird.

 Bugfixes: - Laser cannons / Heavy laser cannons should now not be all mixed up. - Fixed a bug where the station heads and security crew could be revolutionaries and cultists on game start. - If you somehow drop the "Off Hand" that appears if you equip a fire axe, it will be deleted. No more silly "Off Hand" items lying around the station, yay! - If you threw a fire axe when it was wielded, it would would stay wieled. - Metroids should now, theoretically, not be able to phase through thin windows and glass doors. There's probably still going to be some Metroids phasing through thin glass doors if the right circumstances are met (BYOND pathfinding problem, will eventually migrate Metroid pathfinding to SS13's A* system. - Fixed up some of Firecage's half-assed sprites. The decloner projectile in specific. Misc: - Portable turrets can now be equipped with EVERY (except the "plasma gun" because it's stupid anyway) energy gun possible. I want to see laser cannons turrets, emagged energy crossbow turrets, and shock revolver turrets, people! - The decloner is no longer called "decloner" because that term really doesn't make any sense anyway. Does it imply that everyone in existence is actually a clone? While that does sound kind of cool, it's actually pretty stupid, so I changed the name but kept the path type "/obj/item/weapon/gun/energy/decloner". git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1936 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 ADMIN UPDATE - You can now set the dir and name variables for newly spawned objects, turfs or mobs in the game-panel menu. - Dirs are: - 1: north - 2: south - 4: east - 8: west For the rest: - northeast = north + east = 1 + 4 = 5 legal values: 1, 2, 4, 8, 5, 6, 9, 10 Leave the name space blank to keep the default name. If you assign a custom name for a mob, it will also be set as the real_name, meaning it will stick.

 fixed a runtime error auto_use_power only shows up in the master_controller following code: *************** for(var/obj/machinery/machine in machines) if(machine) machine.process() if(machine && machine.use_power) machine.auto_use_power() *************** on the second line it checks if machine exists. If it doesn't exit it would go to the next machine. So it is not null at this point. then it calls machine.process()... on the fourth line it cehcks again if the machine exists. Then it calls machine.auto_use_power() So at this point the machine has been checked twice for existence. Now moving into aut_use_power() proc ********************* /obj/machinery/proc/auto_use_power() if(!powered(power_channel)) return 0 if(src.use_power == 1) use_power(idle_power_usage,power_channel) else if(src.use_power >= 2) use_power(active_power_usage,power_channel) return 1 ********************* This calls powered() on the second line. now stepping into powered() proc ************************** /obj/machinery/proc/powered(var/chan = EQUIP) var/area/A = src.loc.loc // make sure it's in an area if(!A || !isarea(A)) return 0 // if not, then not powered return A.master.powered(chan) // return power status of the area ************************** the second line "var/area/A = src.loc.loc" line 26 in power.dm is what caused the problem. It is asking for the location. src.loc appears to be null. The reason why this call keeps happening and doesn't stop is because the object itself exists but its location does not. So my final analysis is that src.loc == null and calling loc on src.loc gives us a runtime error since src.loc.loc == null.loc and null cannot call loc. runtime error: Cannot read null.loc proc name: powered (/obj/machinery/proc/powered) source file: power.dm,26 usr: null src: Emitter (/obj/machinery/emitter) call stack: Emitter (/obj/machinery/emitter): powered(1) Emitter (/obj/machinery/emitter): auto use power() /datum/controller/game_control...

 There's quite a bit in this revision. Admin changes: Admin attack logs now have a timestamps. Basically, before each log entry there is something that displays [hour:minute:second]. I plan on expanding this functionality to all kinds of logs, as well as creating a global attack log, but this will do for now. Gloves: You can still electrify any gloves with a power cell, however you have to use wires on non-insulated (yellow) gloves to create a "ghetto-insulation" system. I might make these gloves' stun effects more watered-down than normal insulated gloves, but that will probably be for later on. Bugfixes: Fixed some miscellaneous runtime errors, and more importantly, the shotgun. You can dry-pump it by clicking on it, which will eject any used shots or just make that badass "chuck-chick" sound to let everyone know you mean business. Combat shotguns can now shoot twice without the need to pump. I also possibly fixed the issue with metroids' AI process locking up. Someone's going to have to PM me on the forums to tell me if this worked or not, because I have not been able to reproduce the bug (although I do know where it's happening in the code). Chemistry: Alright, so this is where the meat of this update is. In a previous revision (r1905) I mentioned the addition of a new "color" variable. This variable now has a use. When you use a spray cleaner, or a chem sprayer which now is significantly more powerful, the color combination of all the reagents inside the sprayer will be displayed instead of the plain old blue-white color. This will allow for people to easily distinguish reagents and colors, for instance, if you see some chemist running around spraying orange or purple stuff chances are that's acid he's spraying, so you should probably subdue him! In addition, you will now be able to see beakers (large ones too) fill up visually. The color of the reagents inside the beaker is overlayed on top of the beaker. The colors may be subject to change to make them brighter or more easily identifiable by "category". Currently, most pharmaceuticals have a light pinkish color. Polytrinic acid has a distinct purple color, etc. However, with due time I can picture chemists mixing other, benign-ish reagents with harmful reagents so passerbys think that a chemist is spraying someone with something harmless, but in reality is spraying them with a bunch of PAcid. There are some consequences, for instance, concentrated acid is more powerful than watered-down acid. Have fun with that. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1922 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 I ain't gonna lie, this is a pretty big revision. Chemistry: I added a new variable to each reagent called "color". It's a hexadecimal string used to give a reagent a unique color for use in future shenanigans that are in development atm. Updooted the Chemistry-Readme.dm file to include some other variables I included into the recipie system as well as this new color variable. Implementing these colors is still an ongoing effort, and yes you will be able to "blend" these colors. Viruses: Nothing has been CHANGED (yet) but there is some framework for a new virus system to work alongside our current one, special thanks to Googolplexed of Baystation 12! If this weren't tied to some other things I changed, I wouldn't be committing this in the first place. While experimental, you shouldn't even notice this exists. !!BUGFIXES!!: Wow, there's so many I'm having a hard time keeping track of it all! A bunch of runtime errors were hopefully fixed. There were some problems with slicing stuff spitting out runtime errors because an istype() was missing. The same goes for ritual tomes and some other things. Medical cyborgs were also fixed: their pills will now recharge properly and stop spitting out atrocious runtime errors. It was intended for it to be possible to shoot people on top of Mulebots, but a runtime error always cut the proc off before it could execute. This has been fixed. There are probably some other things I'm missing, but all in all, that's about it for the bugfixes. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1905 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Bombs are now less laggy. To go into details: Was some talk going on in the IRC about how bombs were far less laggy in ye olde days, and having a copy of oldcode, I decided to compare the code side by side a bit. With no particularly obvious difference between the two, we assumed atmos was the culprit, it being the laggy cesspool of mystery that it is. CPU profiling a test wherein atmos processing was turned off on tiles being exploded, we discovered that it was in fact the lighting code causing the lag. So exploded walls no longer call sd_SetOpacity. This will likely cause some lighting quirks until we come up with a proper fix, but bombs are much quicker now. http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=jDAHH9x7 The CPU profile where the culprit was discovered. I kept the start and end times as close to the explosion as possible. Compare /proc/explosion's Total CPU (cpu usage of the proc and all procs called by it (and all procs called by THOSE, etc etc)) to /atom/proc/sd_SetOpacity's self CPU, which is the CPU use only the proc itself used. Notice how it accounts for over half of explosion's total CPU usage? So did I. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1904 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Solars fix. Needs the powernet fix to actually work properly. - Solars now bring out a fixed value. 700W each, meaning 60 of them (one array) generates 42000W. Not enough to power the station? That's the point. Although 4 x 42000W = 168000. This might be nerfed soon. - Sun removed. Seriously, that thing ate up processor time and was completely useless. - Solar tracker remains on the map but is completely useless. Will remove. - Also reverted the cable updates from r1729. The code from prior to that revision might be as laggy as it was, but it works properly. After the revision powernets didn't calculate available power properly and did not update properly when new pieces were made (They stopped updating at the first wire piece which ended in a knot (non-smooth cable piece)) git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1897 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Damage system changes: - Environmental heat damage increased by a factor of 1.5 (meaning space and fires cause 50% more damage) - Being without oxygen causes from 0 to 12 damage instead of 0 to 7, depending on how much oxygen is in the atmosphere. Means that if the room's just began to leak there will be no change in the oxygen damage you take compared to the damage prior to this update, but space does 12 damage per tick instead of 7. - Fire suit now protects up to a temperature of 10000 degrees, which is the temperature at which floors start to melt. A toxin + oxy fire usually generates temperatures around 8000-9000 degrees. It used to protect up to 4500 degrees. - Added a standard spacesuit loadout to the admin select equipment menu (LJ's request) I've tested all the changed numbers a lot and they seem to work well. Space and fires are a lot more deadly, while normal circumstances remain at the same level as they are now. I've also researched the bug which allowed you to spend infinity on tiles in space. The problem is that turfs don't process temperature properly, but even after spending 4 hours looking into it (I wish I was joking), I wasn't able to determine where this gets updated on the lowest of levels. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1896 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Added 5 new plants to hydro. Two of them are tomato mutations. A blood mushroom and the blue mushroom. You can get blood from the blood mushroom, and it will soon be used in some new recipes. The blue mushroom is a surprise you will have to see. I added two new types of berry mutations. One is death berry, which is actually a mutation of the poison berry. It is EXTREMELY deadly if ingested. Another is the glow berry. Its brightness depends on its potency. Last, but not least. We have a plant which is both a hydro and harvestable plant, but at the same time a livestock. It is the Walking Mushroom. It is a mutation of the plump helmet. After it is harvested and in your hand, click it to bring from the Walking Mushroom. If it dies, then use a knife on it for Huge Mushroom Slices. Next commit will have more recipes for both chef and barman. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1843 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Food reagent updates because of stuff. Sugary plants, blend them for sugars. Foods Sugar packets are removed, coco paste removed (it is now a reagent), and crushed leaves are removed (due to not taking advantage of the potency system). Blend Coco Pods for Coco! Then add sugar and milk (or soymilk) for a chocolate bar! Or add water for hot chocolate (chocolate milk TBA). Crushed chocolate renamed crushed coco (is a reagent). Kitchen closet has a condiment bottle of sugar in it now, rather than a billion packets of sugar. Candies apples use 5 units of sugar now, rather than a pack of sugar. Modified some new hydroponics plants to take advantage of the potency system. Had a go with a few drink bottles in party crates that weren't showing up due to a typo! Feed Nuka Cola to humans or animals and they won't just spaz out, they will spaz out so much not even the cold can slow them down. Deleted some redundant reagents (there were two lime juices, two creams, and I forget what else). Rearranged a few reagents. Capisin and frost oil never added nutriment factor to start with, and they really shouldn't. That's pretty much it. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1839 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Fixed the freezegun combat tech for building from the Protolathe. Fixed the AI decoy sprites Marauders and Seraphs now have energy relays (the missile racks use up a LOT of charge, this helps with that) The Seraph now has an LBX10 Scattershot instead of an Ultra AC2 LMG, as the AC2 does not damage aliens in any way.

 Note: This will be the last mundane plant for a LONG time. Next shall be various mutations, fantasy, sci-fi and custom plants. Hydro can now grow cocoa trees and harvest cocoa pods. The chef can process the cocoa pods into cocoa and process that into chocolate bars. He can also put the chocolate bars into the blender to get crushed chocolate, which the barman can use. Lemon, watermelon, poison berry juice and crushed chocolate is added to the reagents list. Barman can now also serve a chocolate drink. He can also now serve Lemon, Watermelon and Poison berry juice as drinks. Poison Berry was made a mutation of berries. Nurse uniform was now also fully fixed. PS. Poison berry was added to the juicer machine as well. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1833 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Lablers: - They now have 30 labels each, not 10. Seriously, 10 was too low and 30 should not be too griefy, imo. - Maximum length of one stretch of text increased from 10 characters to 64. - If the combined name of your target object, along with the label is 64, you won't be able to label it to prevent names that are too long. (This safety check has been left unchanged) - You can no longer tag humans as they can just peel the tag off. Sorry clowns, find other ways of being annoying. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1826 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Some mapping changes: Xenobio is now smaller, features one containment cell with shield generator and a monkey pen. Also No longer has a vent in the containment cell. Virology has been updated. It no longer has a window to xenobiology. Virology now has it's own seperated atmos system, you know, contamination and such. Virology now has it's own disposal system. Virology now has an upgraded airlock system, meant to keep any diseases inside. Virology now features a small room for the hard working virologist during quarantines. Virology now spawns with a medical HUD. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1818 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Renamed Security Coft Cap to Security Soft Cap. Gave Apple stuff for hydro a new sprite and also Watermelon. (sprites by Farart) Made watermelon able to be cut with a knife, and now we can also cut produce from hydro, (though for now it is only Watermelon). Added captains gloves to the game and added them to his locker.(By Evilgrim) Added three new food recipies for the chef. Candied Apples, Apple Cake and Apple Pie. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1814 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Viruses: For some reason, viruses were being "cured" just a bit too fast. I lowered the rate which a virus advanced through stages. I also fixed vaccines; they now actually cure viruses as well as providing immunity to any further infection. Metroids: The beginning of my Metroid ranching phase; Metroids may now, theoretically, be tamed to an extent. Baby Metroids are suceptible to simulated discipline, meaning if you beat them over the head with a toolbox for trying to eat your fellow scientists they will probably get the message. This also works when you're trying to wrestle a metroid off of someone's head. Additionally, they may also identify who the people who feed them are and in a situation where they have to fight to defend themselves or eat, they will spare their "friends". This is a pretty big AI change, so if you see any bugs please report them immediately! Metroids can also "vent-crawl" like monkies, but fully-grown adults are too big to do this. NPC Metroids will never vent-crawl. Weapons/Guns: A lot of you are going to like this one; you can no longer shoot yourself with your own gun! This happens sometimes when the game lags up for a bit, but no more! Additionally, you can now shoot people who are on the ground simply by clicking them. I can only imagine how easy this will make being an officer (or traitor/syndicate) now. This applies to both handheld guns and mecha weapon installments. Xenobiology: Scientists now, hopefully, have proper Xenobio access. Metroid dissection has been slightly changed; you can extract Metroid cores from dead Metroids no matter where you're aiming. You will not see me talk about metroid cores anymore because they're a secret. I haven't done anything with them yet, however. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1813 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Added in the first of some work by Trubble_Bass. (A.K.A. Hat Station 13) Fixed the laser gun fire sound. They now sound like lasers again. Fixed some mapping in virology, xenobiology and a small piping error. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1812 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Changes by me: Added two new hats to the station. A Security Coft Hat and a Green Bandana. Security Coft Hat can be found in security lockers. Sugar packs can be found in kitchen locker. Map updated with Green Bandanas in Hydro and one Sec Coft Hat on the security table. Hydro has two new plants, the Athelas Morgan's Tears(which has some healing properties) and the White Beet. White beet and Morgan's Tears can be used on a grinder or blender and made into Sugur and into Crushed Athelas Morgan's Tears respectively. Credits for sprites goes to Farart. -------------------------------------------- Changes by Petethegoat CODING CHANGES: Level 3 biosuit closets no longer have a jumpsuit and shoes in them. MAPPING CHANGES: Virology now has a disposal. It goes straight to space like the ones in xenobio and the incinerator room. Virology now has an air alarm. The monkeys in Virology now have different names than the ones in Genetics. Xenobiology containment rooms have been slightly reduced in size. The boxing ring in the fitness room has thinner glass walls. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1811 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Alright, bunch of changes. CODING CHANGES: New Labcoats for scientists, geneticists, chemists and virologists. Updated the labcoat buttons code to be easily expandable. Changed the file path of the CMO's labcoat and the green because of the buttons change. Added in a silenced pistol into the code, currently adminbus only. SMG can now be constructed via RD. You're going to need a decent amount of materials and tech levels to make it though. MAPPING CHANGES: Virology and Toxins Storage have swapped locations. Virology now has an airlock system at the front door. Hopefully we'll have less random outbreaks now! Virology now has a wall safe. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1800 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Metroids: You can perform some xenobiological dissection on Metroids to get a little something... I also made it impossible to push, drag, or grab Metroids while they're feeding on something.

 Viruses: Oh god, ALL viruses spread through blood contact! This is not good because robot nanites and alien embryo are "SPECIAL" contagions but are still VIRUSES, so they're spread through blood.

 There's a few things in this revision made by me, and some made by other people that requested I commit into the SVN. Please PM the collective coders if you find any bugs in their work. AI: The AI now has a verb that lets it change its appearance. It doesn't do much, but but it's some neat aesthetics that compliment the little display panes scattered around the station that the AI can modify. This was a combined effort between Firecage, Petethegoat, and Superxpdude. Miscellaneous Changes (by Petethegreat): - Cup Ramen sprite changed to a nicer one by Cheridan - Plasma sheet sprite changed to a thicker one by Aru Metroids: They work. There might be some lingering bugs I simply cannot catch by testing alone, but they WORK. They act as an entire new player-controllable race, are found in xeniobiology, and I refuse to say anything else on the matter that would spoil anything. If you feel so entitled to, you can view the source code to spoil everything like a little cheater! I haven't completed everything I would like to, and as a result Metroids are pretty useless. They're still very fun though! Xenobiology, as a result of Metroids, got a bit of expansion. Scientists have access to Xenobiology now, for now. If anyone wants Xenobiology to become a standalone job or whatever, here's the place to post feedback. Bugfixes: - Perriot's Throat virus no longer makes you mute, instead, does what it was intended to HONKHONKHONKHONK!!!! - Some bugfixes with Turrets. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1774 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Some mapping for the tgstation 3.0.0 map. Added in two new guns into the code. An SMG and a Mini-Uzi for the syndicates. Added in two new ammo types for the new weapons. Added in sprites for an M1911 pulse pistol. Coded in an M1911 pulse pistol. M1911 pulse pistol re-added to Creed's office. Added in reverse sprites for sleepers and sleeper consoles. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1773 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 - Redesigned QM office - Cargo bay now has a second ordering console there so cargo techs aren't utterly useless - Mining camera computer now uses the proper sprite ingame too, not just in the editor. - Mining camera computer now actually displays the mining level's cameras. - Mining office access level removed from ID computer and the map. - Clicking on paper now examines is (displays it's text) - To rename paper pick it up and use the 'rename paper' verb - Rad suit crate spawn order switched so it spawns suit-helmet-suit-helmet-... to make dressing slightly easier (you don't need to use move to top or drag stuff out) - blabla crate renamed to juice crate. (I hope to never see a 'blabla' thing in committed code again!) git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1772 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Edited the Industrial Backpack (engie backpack) sprite to hopefully stop it looking like, and I quote, "A pregnant alien hanging from the guy's back", so Agouri doesn't beat me with a metal pipe. Also added in-hand sprites for the pack. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1771 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Created new icon dmi for ai icons. Threw all AI- related stuff in there. Replaced swat gear in assassin equip list with black gloves and shoes. CentCom Commander equip now includes a bullet-proof vest. Upgraded holograms. It is now possible to create them dybamically through getHologramIcon(). If you want to tweak how they look, change that proc. AI can now project holograms for anyone registered on the crew. Holograms that do no fit this category can also be added now (like the one the AI starts with). Added generic holographic projection machinery category. Should now be possible to create wanted hologram projections and two-way communication using holograms. Unfinished but someone else can work on it. Fixed regular cigar sprite from another commit. Fixed deathsquad helmet down sprite. Also, adjusted it to look more unique. Updated swat mask. Made the swat boots use the jackboot sprite. Made swatboots actually as fast as other boots. Added a Honker destroyed and open sprites. Some misc icon tweaks. Ninjas: Adrenaline boost now resets player stat to 0. Due to lag, it was possible to adrenaline boost but remain helpless while life.dm resets stat. It's technically possible to come back from crit health (momentarily, before life.dm knocks you right back in crit) but I think it's a fair tradeoff. Some minor fixes. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1769 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Support for department announcements added to request consoles. To give a console the ability to send announcements, edit it's 'announcementConsole' variable to 1. Requires the "access_RC_announce" access level (59) which is given to all heads of staff by default and can be given by the HoP. Note that department announcements are displayed to all players, but are much smaller than the captain announcements. There is currently no counter or limiter on how many you can send.

 Prep stuff for Erro's big medic update •Sleepers are now OP and heal every kind of damage by the press of a simple button •Cloning through the cloner 25-30% faster. Or so I think, I can't test out cloning by myself, but my change is safe enough. Message me directly if any bugs occur. •Dermaline: New healing drug that's gonna be better than kelotane once Erro nerfs it. Right now it's just a bit more powerful. •No more reagent metabolising or having healing/damaging affects on corpses. Again, this is a kind of a radical change. PM me if any serious bugs occur. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1763 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Okay, there's a couple things up with this revision: Metroids: No, they're not working yet, and I planned on committing this when they were finished, but the basic framework is there. The Metroid in xenobiology now moves around, I guess, kinda like a monkey. ADMINS: !! DO NOT TRY TO POSSESS/CONTROL A METROID, unless you're willing to take a risk! I haven't tested it thoroughly yet, it might have some glitchy results! Turrets: Fixed some lingering bugs with the targetting system. Hopefully these should be pretty stable now. Reagents/Chemicals: I fixed some problems with virus combinations and weird stuff with the PANDEMIC machine. There's probably some other stuff people requested I fix on IRC that I didn't mention, I can't remember anything else though. Hopefully this should stabilize some of the more annoying bugs with reagents! git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1759 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Uplink implant. 'nuff said. The only problem with it is that it doesn't update its window because durp can't pass user arguments to Topic(), so it uses usr by default, which doesn't work in this case. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1757 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Added in some new boots for security to use. Added in a bulletproof vest and laser protective vest, both spawn in the armory and in armor crates. Security Officers spawn with their new boots. Security Lockers now have the new boots inside them. Some MULEbot patching thanks to Trubble_bass. The PDA list should no longer show the hallway navigation beacons. Shuttle walls are no longer autosmoothed. This has to be done manually in the map as it was causing some graphical errors. Added in new boots and armor sprites. Credit goes to Firecage for them. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1755 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Detective's office No longer noir anymore. The monochrome effect was lagging people who saw it for the first time in the round up due to the icon operations and it was just too high of a cost for this. Kitchen Removed the chance of xenomeat being spawned. Hydro I accidentally a default icon_state. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1754 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Okay, this is a pretty big revision! Viruses: The virus system was COMPLETELY reworked. Good news, Virologists! This means people can now be infected by multiple viruses at once. Some of the virus-spreading protocols were tweaked to support this change, and as a result, they are now considerably more infectious. I also changed some background reagent variables to better support DNA, blood type, and virus combination. Turrets: Fixed some lingering bugs that would bog down the global event processor. Changelings: People turned into "husks" after being drained of their DNA by changelings can no longer be cloned. Miscellaneous: I tweaked a LOT of mob code. This shouldn't have any noticeable impact on anything, but was required in order support the virus overhaul. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1753 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Jelly Donuts - have a unique sprite frosted/ unfrosted. - Have jelly in them once more. Food & Recipes: - Things involving poison mushrooms have poison in them. - Xeno meat contains no nutriment, it is all nasty Xenomicro eggs. - Soups have all their water back - Wish soup, because apparently everyone likes having all that water in their foods. Reagents - Banana is a mysterious reagent that has healing properties to monkeys, and clowns! Perhaps it is that less than 2% difference in clown and monkey DNA? - Juice is now less effective than tricordizine. Each heals a unique damage type. - Cream and milk both do about the same thing now (slight chance to heal brute damage). - Ramen Noodle reagents add to nutriment value once more. Syntiflesh - I accidentally a whole catalyst. - Clonexydone was meant to be a reagent, not a catalyst in the formula. Feeding monkeys and Xenos - It is possible now to feed carbon based mobs food, and for all carbon based mobs to feed themselves (except for xenos who cannot pick up items much smaller than bulky sized). - What this means: You can force feed Monkeys bananas now. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1752 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Riot Helmet and Riot Suit adjusted for balance. Added a new computer sprite. AI upload and Cyborg Upload now use the new sprite. Added the Riot Helmet and Riot Suit to the Riot crate and the Armor crate. The prices of both have both been upped to accommodate the change. Spacefriend(tm) boxes have been changed slightly. You can now construct cyborg uploads. Edited the Riot Helmet Sprite. Edited the Riot Suit Sprite. Added a sprite for a medical records laptop. Added a medical records laptop to the CMO's office, right now it's just a resprited computer.

 New Construction: Automatic Portable Turrets Items required to construct: any energy gun, a proximity sensor, a screwdriver, wrench, a welder and a total of 9 metal. This turret can best be described as a mixture of an ED-209 and an AI turret. It fires the same projectile as the gun it uses, and has a few customizable behaviours for people with security access to play with. The turrets can be unbolted and dragged off to be deployed anywhere, but can not turn on and shoot unless it's bolted into place. Can be controlled by the AI and cyborgs, but isn't controlled by /area's in the same way normal AI turrets are. This will probably be expanded on in the future if I or one of the other coders want it to be expanded. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1746 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Syntiflesh update: - Syntiflesh is going to be used in surgery to give people new faces. - syntiflesh can be used in any recipe that requires normal meat. - syntiflesh is made from 5 units of blood and 1 unit of clonexydone. Plasma as a catalyst -5 units of Plasma will be required as a catalyst in: Dexalin, Clonexydone, and Lepozine (requires copper as reagent now). -NOTE: Catalysts are not consumed in reactions! Clonexydone and cryoxydone - result per reaction is three (it used to equal 10 per 3 unit reaction, that made no sense). - Cryoxydone remove a slight amount of cloning damage at 170K. Drinks - 4 new drinks! Atomic Bomb, 3 mile island ice tea, patron, and goldschlager! - Look in the recipe code for how to mix each of them up. Sprites: -Added new Ore sprite for uranium, by Aru - Drink and bottle sprites by Aru - Manipulated Atomic bomb (drink) sprite from Aru and me. - Unused yellowcake sprite (I need to tweak it a little more) Food -Stream lined some food (removed WATER Reagents) - Modified the nutriment value of other foods based on ingredients. -Remember, Amanita is a poisonous mushroom! And, food made from it is also toxic. Several new and exciting items added to reagent grinder: -Bananas, carrots, liberty caps, chili peppers (ice too), and nettles. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1742 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Added reminder message for deathsquad armored squad. Also, new deathsquad helmet, now with more space protection. Added Seraph exosuit. A command-type marauder with slightly better stats and different equipment. Found in CentCom. Changed Marauder access to centcom special ops. Marauders now come equipped with an armor booster module. When entering exosuits, the exosuit will now face in the appropriate direction. Affects Durand, Gygax, and Phazon. Minor changes to CentCom. Fixed a minor bug with respawn character. It should no longer report character destroyed for object completion for brand-new characters. Fixed gas mask icons for monkeys. Nerfed monkey vent crawling. Monkey needs to be naked to crawl through vents. And not hold anything in their hands/paws. Merged CentCom with z-level 6 (hand tele adjusted for z level 2). Deleted ship building docks since they are not used. Z-level 6 left empty. Detectives can now name their gun. Right click to use the verb, when holding the item. Energy swords/cutlasses will properly change icons now when activated or deactivated. Same with energy axes. Changed some melee weapon paths a bit to accomodate this (and so they're easier to track). Replaced cigar icons with sprites by Matty. Made matches smaller. Added a welder and assassin costumes to admin equip list. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1741 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

In light of an incoming tournament on ss13.ru I have added "Select equipment" right click command. It allows to instantly dress mob as you wish. Coders, feel free to add more dress packs, like "centcom inspector", "space pirate" and so on. A strange command "list_occ" now called "List free slots" and shows unoccupied jobs.

 - Moved passability flags from atom/var/flags to atom/var/pass_flags. Currently there are three - PASSTABLE, PASSGLASS and PASSGRILLE. PASSTABLE - same as TABLEPASS, PASSGRILLE - can this atom pass through grilles and PASSGLASS - can this atom pass through windows, glass doors, etc. Most can_pass() procs were updated. Added checkpass atom proc to check if this atom has certain pass_flag set. - Added proc/sanitize_simple() and proc/strip_html_simple(). sanitize_simple does not html_encode the string and strip_html_simple does not sanitize it. Additionally, sanitize_simple and sanitize can take associative list of key-val chars as second argument, where key is char to searh for and val is replacement. - Added datum/gas_mixture/proc/return_volume() and datum/gas_mixture/proc/return_temperature(). - Added proc/tg_text2list() and proc/tg_list2text(). tg_list2text is slower then dd_list2text, but processes associative lists differently (it adds not the keys, but associated values). tg_text2list is somewhat faster then dd_text2list. - Added proc/listclearnulls(), proc/difflist(), proc/intersectlist() and proc/uniquemergelist(). Check the code comments for more info. - Mechs can hold 3 equipment pieces. Gygax can hold 4. - Tweaked global_iterator CRASH report. - Fixed mech pilot ejection if mecha was destroyed. - Fixed mech fabricator process() waiting for sync() to finish. - Fixed mech fabricator Topic() waiting for process_queue() to finish. - Some bugixes related to global map and random sectors. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1722 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Merged some revisions from the branch with the trunk. List of changes: E-Guns are now back in the armory. Shotgun is now back in the bar. Medical and Security HUDs can now be constructed via R&D. Fixed the spelling in the Autolathe board on the R&D console. It used to say "Atuolathe". Added the colourful syndicate suits into the game. Added the colourful syndicate helmets into the game. Added Detective's armor using the detective's armor sprite. All tables on the map are replaced with the default instances since we have smooth tables. Medical Anesthetic closets now spawn with medical masks instead of breath masks. Detective's armor spawns in forensics lockers. Finally finished the cyborg manual from a while back. Many useless aesthetic wires removed to help reduce lag. Two sleepers located in medbay lobby. EVA racks now spawn with breath masks instead of medical masks. Engineering RIG racks now spawn with breath masks instead of medical masks. Three copies of the Cyborg Manual are located on the map. One in the RD's office, one in robotics and one in the CE's office. The Atmospherics mix tank now starts with no air inside. So that now you no longer have to drain the air before mixing gases. Added in some icons for new possible chemist, virologist, geneticist and scientist jumpsuits. Coded in those jumpsuits, they aren't used anywhere yet though. Added in a new lawyer's suit. Added in a new suit jacket for the lawyer. Can be buttoned up or unbuttoned using the command under the "objects" tab. Added in a sprite for a Riot Helmet. Coded in a riot helmet and riot suit. Not used anywhere though. Lawyer now spawns wearing his new suit and suit jacket. Orange prisoner jumpsuit now has suit sensors forced fully on. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1711 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Reduced deathsquad marauder number to 3 (previously 4). Added some fluff to their launch sequence. Revisions to CentCom. CentCom now has its own access levels set, and a unique ID changing computer. Added nasa void suit and captain armor to item steal list. Fixed some run time errors for hand-tele from my previous commit. Removed the remove poo and urine button from secrets. Decoy AIs can now say stuff like regular AIs. This is useful if you need a non-player announcer for something, while taking into account talk_understand and the like. I use it for deathsquad shuttle announcements. I've placed A.L.I.C.E. on CentCom for such reasons. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1704 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Freaking big GAMEMODES UPDATE. I have done lots of work to make selecting players for special roles be fair. - New options preferences: "be traitor", "be changeling" and so on for all special roles. - Now you can have job of AI/cyborg in preferences and do not lower your chances to become wizard/changeling/etc. And vice-versa: you do not have to select AI in your preferences to have non zero chance to play malf. - Jobban from syndicate bans player from any special role (including malf AI, cult, etc). - Fixed bug with changeling round not ending sometimes. - All special roles were tuned to work better as admin-driven event. -- All adminmade special characters will be listed at the end of round of any type. -- All adminmade special characters are fully functional with following exceptions: --- The ending conditions are determined at round start, i.e. you cannot end revolution by killing wizards and malf AIs (however, with nuke you can end anything). --- The cultists cannot get their special objectives. --- The malf AI can hack the APCs but without any profit. --- The syndicate operatives must obtain the nuke/working code from admins. --- As before, nuclear explosion ends round. Even if nuke was used in wrong place. - Fixed thingy like "Not enough players for revolution game mode. Restarting world in 5 seconds." - Changeling wont get objective "absorb X genomes" when there are less that X players in game. - proc/equip_if_possible now has return value, procs like equip_revolutionary (giving a flash) should be more reliable. - There are no fake wizards anymore. The research staff have to kill ALL wizards on order to win, even adminspawned ones. ("give spell" verb works as before, not making a spellcaster to actually be wizard). - The semi-new game mode: traitor+changeling. Just like regular traitor mode plus one changeling. Round ends when the shuttle reaches centcom. Option for config.txt: "PROBABILITY TRAITORCHAN". - Successful malf AI now have 60 seconds to choose to explode the station or not (some players still have to rejoin game to have their new verbs shown in Malfunction tab). - Monkeys mode fixed, monkeys wouldn't randomly cure anymore. For admins: - New powerful mind editor oriented to mixed rounds. -- Setting someone as special character (like wizard) does not equip him/her automatically. You have to do it it next step. Note, that in case of wizards and nuke operatives their old dress will be deleted! If you do not want it you shall use "undress" link. -- Only operatives, head revs and cultists have their objectives set immediately. -- You can unemad borgs! -- You cannot unemag borgs because calling mind editor for nonhumans is blocked atm. -- many other useful features. -- you can fix burned out flashes from mind editor. -- first assign the new malf AI/wizard then demalf/dewizard old one or round will immediately end. - if delete the nuke bomb during its downcounting round will stuck. Using "edit ticker variables" set ticker.mode.explosion_in_progress = 0. For coders: - /datum/game_mode/malfunction/AI_Module renamed to /datum/AI_Module. Reason: What. The. Fuck. Unrelated fixes: - Blueprints can create areas up to 300 tiles (was 100). - Cyborgs wont leave backpacks at spawn point anymore. - Fixed bug in preferences causing preferences files to be huge. - Diseases can infect again. - The option "SQL_ENABLED 0" now works in config.txt. - fixed critical bug on assassinate objective. Bugs: - We have a bug with job distribution for people who haven't any available jobs in their preferences. Players tends to group by jobs. - For example, if we have 3 players they with hight chances will got same jobs. And probability of having one engineer and one medic _exactly_ equals _zero_. - I am not sure if my changes made that bug worse. Anyway I MUST do this commit. Bug will be fixed eventually. Maybe. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1703 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Ninjas are now a random event. They may appear in most game modes after about an hour, with an assigned objective list. Fixed aliens :a talking while dead. Disabled hand-tele on clown-planet z-level since people were still finding ways to abuse it. PDA menu will close properly if detomatrix fails and explodes own PDA. Late joiners are now added to minds. It's now possible to assassinate them, and so on, as an objective. Added a few more objectives (capture, steal brain of, protect, and download research) and new possible items to steal (also fixed admin-added steal objectives). Mostly focused on ninjas but admins can give them to regular traitors. Only research downloading is outright impossible for regular traitors (they must wear a ninja suit). Added a few revisions to mind/objective datums and a few other things. The game should now report any extra antagonists for most round types, excluding AI malfunction. Added two new words to station_name.dm. Other misc changes. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1698 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Okay I'm done testing on the players, I've set the diseases for cold9 and spanish flu to their own disease path stuffs. Grenades - Quick patch because some one wanted to make an "allowed list", but rather than make the beakers loaded use the allowed list... they used a single item path (for single beakers). It is just a few OR experssion so bottles and dispenser beakers can be used in grenade assemblies. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1692 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 #Fixed Chaplain hoodie sprite. #Respawn_character() now properly respawns aliens and monkeys if specified to do so. #Added more options in admin quick panel (for players) to get, send, check if traitor, narrate, and subtle message mob. #Admins can now click an X by admin name, in asay, to jump to that admin. Makes things easier. #Moved admin transform verbs into fun tab. #Removed boom boom shake the room since not even hosts are allowed to use it. #Pierrot's throat now has a 35% chance of being cured by eating bananas. Up from 5. #Fixed AI cards. #ed209 and Beepsky now properly figure in deafness when speaking. Doesn't affect voice files. #Fixed Syndicate PDA not triggering door. #Aliens can no longer magically crawl to the prison station and back. #Aliens can now quickly (5 seconds) break out of cuffs by resisting. No change to buckled. #Facehuggers will now properly set the alien_egg_flag if the target was infected or not. Curing the alien egg should also reset the flag. I think it will be best to get rid of the flag entirely in the future. #Added isalienadult(mob) proc to check for humanoid aliens. #Probably fixed death squad spawning. They pick by key now, instead of mob name. #Spawning xenos now uses the client match method so you can specify who you want to respawn if wanted. #Ninjas now tell admins what their set mission is. If given objectives by admin, it should report them at round end for certain rounds. #Spawning ninjas now uses the same method as respawn character (typing in key/ckey). #Added a ninjify admnin verb. Possible to right click. #Can now resize spiderOS window. #Misc fixes and adjustments.

 STORAGE ITEMS UPDATE: - All code is now standardized. No more copy-pasted code for each item individually. - It is now possible to edit the following things with variables alone (ingame too): - Storage slots number: Ingame HUD support for up to 21 items. - Max w_class: the maximum w_class of items that the storage item can hold. Note that it will not be able to hold storage items of the same size as it is to prevent the stacking of storage items in eachother. - Can hold: List of items that the item can hold (old) - Can't hold: List of items that the item specifically can't hold. (Use in the same way as can_hold, not used at the moment) - Syringe boxes are no longer listed as first aid kits. I don't think this will affect anything but who knows. - The HUD interface for storage items is slightly changed. It's just the X button is positioned one tile to the right of the bottom-right-most tile. This is needed for the correct expanding of the HUD. I THINK I applied all the changes to these settings for all the items that used copy-pasted and slightly altered code. If there are any anomalies anywhere, let me know. If you find any special attackby() procs that still remain, delete them or tell me about them. Thanks. Also: I checked to make sure first aid bots and floorbots are constructable. Also: Listing myself as Game Master in the svn copy of admins.txt so I don't have to do it manually every time I do a fresh checkout. I need this to access the mapping helpers and since it doesn't cause any effects to the game, I don't see any potential problems with this. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1683 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

Whether a z-level is accessible through space travel is now defined in a variable (in code/setup.dm): var/list/accessable_z_levels = list("1" = 10, "3" = 15, "4" = 60, "5" = 15) The string is the z-level number and the other one is the chance for travel. Currently, whenever you get to the edge of the map: 10% chance of getting to SS13. 15% chance of getting to the AI sat. (Hopefully will discourage borgs from jumping out the airlock in hope of getting to the AI sat) 60% chance of getting to the derelict. 15% chance of getting to the mining level. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1672 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

HoP doesn't start with surgery or virology access now, desk jockies should stay at the desk. Chemistry update: Reagent Grinder! Grinds reagents out of corn, plasma crystals, uranium, gold, and silver! Will add more later, as needed. The mined reagents will have many chemistry uses soon, but for now they aren't very useful in a ground state right now.

 CHANGELOG UPDATED Cult mode update: Arcane tome now has a "notes" option. Set English translations for runewords which come up when scribing runes. Attack an arcane tome with an arcane tome to copy your notes to the target tome. Totally copied the idea of minecraft maps. No syncing though. Stun rune buffed considerably. Its a 1-use item so it deserved more power. Tome text: Added missing description for stun rune. I failed to implement some interface/additional check shit so you might want to check out commented parts of the code. At least it compiles and doesnt spam runtime errors. Too frustrated and unskilled to do it on my own. Figuring the way those HTML windows work has been hard enough already. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1669 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Wizard will now report if they mind swapped with a person after round completion. Or in other words, if they're in a different body than round start. Changing changelings during the round should probably work proper now. AI will now report that people woken up from cryo sleep, when they join. The arrival shuttle changed to accomodate this. Added poff to pAIs until TLE revises that whole process. You should be able to message them back now. Slighly revised the entry shuttle. Added a holding facility to CentCom. Made the DJ station fully unsimulated. Removed unsimulated floor from derelict. Hopefully I got all the tiles. NOTE: When simulated floor meets unsimulated floor, Atmos goes berserk. Don't do this. Also, you can't deconstruct unsimulated stuff. A few other misc adjustment to the map. Added a variable to Rev that tracks what heads are supposed to be assassinated. Not sure why it didn't exist before. Added some ticker mind checking to a few procs I forgot about. Yup. Added an option to check assassinate objectives by special role. Some foundation for future ninja stuff. Ninjas now swap battery by clicking on their suit with the battery in hand.

 Addendum to: r1655 #Added an icon helper procs library by Lummox Jr. #Added more icon+overlay functionality by DarkCampainger. Both can be found under icon_procs.dm. #Added continuous beam code by Gunbuddy to atom.dm. You can now create continuous beams of energy/magic/monkeys/whatever. For instance, pAI cords. It's really awesome. #Like optical camo? Well I have good news. New stealth "graphic." May need some fine tuning depending on player/coder preference. It's also a little slow to change (due to update_clothing()). With that said, it's a lot cooler than what we had before. Check it out. #Added the getIconMask() and AddCamoOverlay() procs for the above. #Added animated satic filter icons by Koil to icons. #New force wall and shield icons. Shield icons moved to effects.dmi. #Changed up the abandoned mining station. #Moved a few carp spawn points closer to the station. Added a few more. Ninjas: No longer spawn whoknowswhere like they did at times before. Get a unique stealth graphic. Yup. Also, small chance of failure. New energy net icon and effects. Energy net now uses the beam code mentioned above. It will now check for stealth. Fixed some graphical icon issues with ninja suit. Added a female black jumpsuit to icons for this reason. Added icon directions to ninja effects. Some more general code cleanup. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1664 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Gun Code Overhaul Phase 1: (Now with 50% less wasted code!) - Gun code condensed to make future modifications easier. Functionality should (mostly) remain the same. - Taser guns shoot ONE WHOLE SHOT more then they do now. Yippy! - Energy Crossbow has a slightly higher shot capacity (still automatically recharges). - Guns that shoot projectiles (such as revolvers) now eject the ammo casings when they fire (this will be adjusted somewhat in phase 2). - Revolvers can either be loaded one shell at a time or all at once with an ammo box. - All guns now have a badmin var. Have fun (think shotguns). - A few admin-only guns have been removed (for now). They'll get re-added in a future update. - Shotguns no longer need to be pumped before firing (will change back in phase 2). - All gunshots fired by players are now logged in both the firer's and the target's attack_log. So if someone gets shot and it doesn't show up, it's because a turret or something shot them. Hopefully I didn't miss anything. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1659 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Chucking my powered armor onto the SVN It could use a fair amount of refinement and/or additional features yet, but it is functional. It is currently adminbus only, until I get some non-placeholder sprites. Already have some on the way from a pretty decent spriter, but don't let that discourage you, more types of power armor are always welcome. Current model is fueled by processed plasma ore from the mine. Each unit of plasma provides roughly 2 minutes of power, the tank holds 2 units worth of fuel at a time, and can be refilled while the suit is active. I'll probably include a powercell and self-sustaining version when I add in the code to make this sucker buildable via R&D While unpowered, the suit slows you waaaaaay down, is not spaceworthy, and is inferior to regular armor. While powered, it is between regular and syndicate spacesuits in speed, can be worn in space, and has much better armor. Also, while powered it cannot be unequipped, much like an initialized ninja suit. The helmet is required for the suit to be able to power up, and if the suit powers down for any reason other than the user initiating the powerdown sequence, the suit does NOT unlock, so you're stuck in a crappy slow metal suit until you can get it powered up to properly power it down. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1658 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 pAI suicide verb renamed to avoid conflicts with existing suicide verb - should function for non-admins now. Admins playing pAIs should no longer have their pAI interface appear every time they send or receive an Admin-PM. pAIs are now affected by EMP bursts. pAIs hit with a burst will be silenced (no speech or PDA messaging) for two minutes and may have their directives or master modified. A sufficiently powerful EMP burst will have a 20% chance of killing a pAI. The Player Panel now lists pAIs below humans. Added a new admin command : Make pAI. Allows admins to manually spawn a specific player as a pAI at a given location. PDAs and pAI devices pass emp_act()s into their contents list, largely to allow pAIs contained within to respond properly to EMP bursts. pAI now understand brain/MMI speech without the aid of a Universal Translator. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1656 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 #Huge code overhaul and cleanup for ninjas. Basically, the suit is about as modular now as I probably care to make it. Admins, read the commented text under Admin Notes, in space_ninja.dm. Tell your friends. #Ninja suit now supports pAIs. Further functionality will probably come from their development. #Ninja suit can now replenish chemicals from beakers. Simply use a beaker on the suit and it will do the rest, if the beaker contains the right combination of chemicals. #Draining from a wire is now done through clicking instead of a verb. There is no more delay to it. #Ninja stars cost a bit more energy than before. #Ninja suit will start initializing automatically (and quickly) when ninja spawned. #Minor sprite fix for female ninja suit. #Note: AI-related verbs for the ninja suit will be bugged until BYOND 484 comes out. Not a huge deal but worth noting. #The has_reagent() proc will now return the reagent being checked for, instead of 1. Will return 0 if reagent is not found (or the amount does not match). Removed a duplicate arithrazine entry. #AIs should now properly camera_cancel() when carded/physically transfered. #Fixed a small menu display bug for AI cards. AI cards should now properly auto close their window when appropriate. #AI holograms should now project above everything. #Mal AIs can now choose to display an alternative (and awesome) sprite. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1655 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Tech Origin update: -Various item have had their tech origins updated or added to. -Items that just use metal or glass have their materials origin lowered -Items that use more advance materials have their materials tech origin raised to equal the uncommon material. Engineering Tech research: -Engineering tech origin, because Materials tech origin is just for being able to manipulate rare/ new materials for production. -Engineering tech field focuses on various engineering items, and will increase in scale as time goes on. -Various items (especially tools and mech parts) use the engineering tech origin. Mining tools update: - Drills can dig up sand. - Plasma cutters can cut down walls and girders, and set fire to thermite, and be used in the reinforced wall deconstruction stages in place of the welder. - Diamond drills can drill though walls, and girders, and can drill through the plating of reinforced walls. Tech Origin changes and Circuit boards: -If it requires a special material to make, it now have a materials origin equal to that special material. General glass circuit boards do not require materials research. -Engineering research should be applied (reasonably) to the board if it is a machine, computers should stick to programing (even if the computer is related to an engineering field). -Still a work in progress, as always. Last update: -Shovel sprite is back to being a digging shovel in style, a scooping shovel is terrible at digging. I should know, I've dug many holes in my days, and a scooping shovel is terrible, and a spade head is much better. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1654 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Multi-tile horizontal pod doors have been added. (2 tile and 4 tile width) Note for veyveyr: The vertical dmi-s are not made properly, they're 64x32 when they should be 32x64 and 32x128. Since you have the originals somewhere on your computer, I'd request that you make the dmi have vertical sprites as it's probably much easier to do for you than it is for me without the originals... cutting everything out by hand, ugh... git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1647 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 More pAI fixes. Apparently silicon based mobs automatically get access to Robotic Talk - since pAIs aren't bound by AI laws this could be incredibly game breaking for rogue borgs/AIs. Also changed viewers() to hearers() when checking to see if MMIs/Intelicards/et all can hear something, so they're no longer deaf in the dark. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1638 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 - Abandoned ship, wizard's den, the shuttles east of the beach, DJ station, the syndicate shuttle and large parts of the derelict are now made from unsimulated turfs. This reduces air group processing by about a third and has the effect of noticeably reducing lag. The currently present downside is that you cannot interact with them. I'd like to give this a test because I believe the tradeoff is worth it as my tests have shown a massive reduction in lag. Unsimulated turfs now hide wire nad pipes and such things under them, - Moved all floors to code/game/turf.dm so they're all in one place (Other than asteroids I guess, those are still in mining.dm) . Shuttle walls now look at unsimulated floors too when determining the underlay for diagonal wall pieces. - Some areas around the station that were with air but were intended to be airless are now airless. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1628 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Reverted 1624. The proc in question is for regular players only. This may change in the future but not right now. New sound effect for ninja phasing. Added a female-only ninja suit sprite. Will conform to the character once initialized. Stealth is now a an equipment verb and functions a little different from before. I may tweak it a bit in the near future. BYOND fixed a verb bug in r484. Certain ninja verbs will now function as intended once the release version comes out. I've went ahead and made the necessary code adjustments for it.

 Barman renamed Bartender, because I am a femmi nazi. Monkeys have several bugs fixed on them, shooting them with weak bullet rounds now works! Also, fixed monkeys not showing being KO/ burned without having brute damage on them first. New chemistry reagents. That'll be required for a upcoming update to chemistry when grinding up refined ore will get reagents or something. Silver, gold, and Uranium. Bar drinks now have resulting units in mixtures equal to all liquids stirred in. No more 50 unit martinis from 30 units gin and vermouth anymore! Map updates - Fixed a maintenance tunnel with no air. Updated Bartender spawn point (so you don't spawn on loading screen). git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1626 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Fixed Narsie Instead of being a var-edited singularity (which ends up following the normal singularity rules), narsie is now a child object of the singularity, with modified code to prevent it from doing things like changing size or getting exploded by R&D throwing a bluespace backpack into it.

 Doors now hide items under them, unless they're open. If they're open they're displayed under objects. For coders: Layer = 2.4 (Pipes) Layer = 2.5 (Wire) Layer = 2.7 (open doors) Layer = 2.8 (tables) Layer = 2.9 (grille) Layer = 3.0 (regular items and windows and most stuff, really) Layer = 3.1 (closed, opening and closing door) Layer = 4.0 (mobs) There is a slight annomality that can occur but it shouldn't be too common, It happens when you have a closed fire door and a closed airlock over it. When you open the airlock, the opened airlock sets it's layer to 2.7, which is under the closed firedoor's layer 3.1, This causes the airlock to appear under the firelock while closed. I also removed the window in the kitchen counter. Personally I think it looks better than the old, strange zig-zagging videow. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1617 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Fixed a bug from 1607. Observing and the like should work properly now regardless of config. May need more testing but looks solid on my end. DONT_DEL_NEWMOB in config.txt is no longer necessary and you can remove it entirely. Respawn character now uses ckey() matching so it doesn't matter what case you type in a person's key. It also takes into account space ninjas and death commandos if you want to respawn them. Also fixed a few bugs dealing with special roles. Revised code for checking security records and added missing ranks as per bug report by Magicbones. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1614 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 #Finished the respawn_character proc. Use it to quickly bring a player back into the game with their previous character if they were gibbed/deleted. If you want them to make a new character, kick them out and let them rejoin. Can also be used to quickly enter the game by admins and the like. It's fairly robust so you can read the code to find out what it does (and does not). #Added a locked list to datacore in order to track character spawn, particularly for respawn_character(). May be useful in the future. #Added a proc to randomize appearance for any human mob, randomize_appearance_for(mob). It will not take into account gender as you will have to provide it. Names and so on are also randomized but that can be overwritten in the code following. #Added AI holopads around the station. To use as the AI: click on the pad to center view on it. Click again to activate the hologram. Move it with the directional keys. You can still interact with objects normally. To remove it, either move it too far out or click the pad again. Use robot talk to directly speak through the holopad (and only the holopad, unlike regular robot speak). Could be added on to (like different images for different AIs) but it's basically finished. #Fixed a bugged message on changeling transformation sting. It will no longer give away your identity. #Made law datum a silicon define. var/datum/ai_laws/laws. #A few more ninja adjustments. Added a new view mode for the ninja mask, allowing to see special roles and a few other things. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1608 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

Measures radiation of a mob. #Brain/MMI code overhaul. Brains/MMIs should no longer screw up when the brain is deleted. MMIs should now properly eject from cyborgs if they are blown up, among other changes. Brains no longer die when transferred between containers but won't be able to speak without a container. #Added a research MMI that comes with a radio built in. The brain can toggle the radio functions on or off via verb panel (MMI). #Traitor code words will now use the crew roster for name generation 70% of the time. #Ghostize() is now a lot more robust. If you need to throw someone into a ghost if they are killed/whatever, use it. #Deleting a mob will now spawn a ghost for it through ghostize(), if it has a key, so you don't need to worry about that. You can null key people if you want to kick them out of the game. #Ghost verbs are now in their own panel (Ghost). ghost() is the proc/verb that mobs get to turn into ghosts. ghostize() is now a proc only used through other procs. #Changed how ninjas get their verbs. Long story short, wizards are now able to mind swap with ninjas. Stay hidden Snake! Also, more code improvements and additions to ninjas, including more fun for the AI. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1607 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Cables now come in four colors: Red, yellow, green and blue. Engineer belts spawn with either red or yellow ones while electrical toolboxes spawn with any color. All three coils in a toolbox are the same color. Also yes, yes, if you are really bothered by the fact that picking up a green wire piece with a blue coil will result in all of them being blue then that's fine, but I really think it's more than good enough for a game. It will also allow people who want to use a particular color the abbility to get enough wire pieces of it without unneeded problems. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1593 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Cables can now be placed more freely. If there is a cable going from south to east and you wish to place a cable from south to center it will now allow you to do this. It now only checks if there is identical wire on a tile already to prevent two identical pieces from being placed one on top of the other. This should make wiring tight places slightly easier as well as more possibilities for wire art. Enjoy.

 Armor Overhaul, phase 3. Went through and added armor values to shit. #Jumpsuits have very light (2%) laser/taser protection. #Security (includes warden, HoS, and detective) and nuke team jumpsuits have some melee/bullet/bomb protection, as well as slightly higher (5% total) laser/taser protection #Medical jumpsuits have light bio protection #Engineering jumpsuits have light radiation protection (also light laser protection, since emitters fall under laser protection) #Security's bomb/biosuits are more armored than nonsecurity variants. #Biosuits block alium spit #Detective's coat has some degree of protectiveness now, but not as much as regular armor #Labcoats are similar to biosuits, but not as effective #Real wizard robes are magical, applying a measure of protection to the entire body. #Fake wizard robes are less magical, applying very little protection only to the covered body parts THESE VALUES ARE RELATIVE TO THE OLD VALUES, SINCE THESE THINGS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN PROTECTIVE #Armor vests are slightly worse at melee/bullet protection, but slightly better against laser/taser #HoS/thunderdome armor is slightly better at laser/taser #Captain's armor is worse at melee than armor vest, but better than it at laser/taser. #Swat/heavy armor is better against laser/taser #RIG has some armoring #syndicate/ninja/pirate spacesuits have slightly better armoring than RIG #Helmets/gloves/shoes have armor values to match the suit they go with (armor vests for generic helmets) ##This means that spacesuit helmets/hardhats/weldingmasks are no longer far more protective than they have any right to be. #Insulated gloves are pretty good at blocking taser shots if anyone happens to be aiming at your hands. Might have missed a few things, this was a lot of numbers. Also, sorted head.dmi so sprites are properly paired up. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1588 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Smooth tables added Tables now automatically determine which direction and sprite they'll use. They will connect to any adjacent table unless there is a window between them (regular, reinforced, tinted, whichever) To achieve this I had to reverse all sprite directions in the dmi file, this means that on the dreammaker map, every single table piece faces the exact opposite way. I will fix this on monday but can't at the moment. There are no issues on the map tho as all the dirs get recalculated at map load and whenever an adjacent (cardinal or diagonal) table is created or deleted. Ingame I removed the annoying CORNER/SIDE/ALONE, EAST/WEST/N... blabla menu as it determines this by itself now. So yeah, smooth tables. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1583 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 ChemLab 13 update: - In containers where there isn't a perfect ratio of reagents, reactions won't consume ALL of the related reagents (so if you mix 10 anti-toxin with 20 inaprovaline, you get 10 tricordrazine and 10 inaprovaline rather then just 10 tricodrazine). - NOTE TO CODERS: I couldn't find a clean way around this (and this is true with the old code) but if two reactions are possible with a given combination of reagents, the one listed first in Chemistry-Recipes.dm reacts first. However, it's been changed so that if there are reactions X and Y (in that order) and Y makes a reagent required in X, you'll still get reaction X (before, reaction X would just be ignored). I guess this is a semi-bugfix. - New reaction variable: required_catalysts. Catalysts are reagents required for a reaction to occur. However, unlike required_reagents, catalysts are NOT consumed as part of the reaction. A few reactions were changed as a result and more might be in the future. If coders want some but not all of a catalyst to be consumed in a reaction, just have the reagent appear in both required_reagents and required_catalysts. It won't break anything. - Because of the addition of catalysts, all recipes that require Universal Enzyme now require 5 units of the enzyme but the enzyme isn't consumed (So Tofu, Cheese, Moonshine, Wine, Vodka, and Kahlua recipes). - Sterilzine reaction now works properly (it's anti_toxin, not anti-toxin). git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1578 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Armor Overhaul, phase 2 Rewrote the armor checking proc, it now checks mask, head, jumpsuit, gloves, shoes, and suit slot for armor values, and selects the most protective item that covers the targeted area. This means that phase 3 is going to be a pain in my ass, since a lot more things can actually matter in terms of armor values. Also included a full-body armor check, which checks ALL bodyparts for protective values, and averages them out. This is currently only used for explosions, and mainly only means you now also have to actually wear the bomb suit hat to be considered fully protected (though the suit alone still provides a 90% chance of not getting gibbed from a max-severity explosion) As with phase 1, testing consisted of attacking myself and standing in turrets, and also included dropping explosions on myself while in a bombsuit since I changed the bombsuit code. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1570 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 AI's that do not name themselves after 20 seconds will default to their starting name. Added a direction finding algorithm for target, get_dir_to(). Mostly useful for positioning sprites in relation to a target. Such as energy beams, lines, and so on. Changes to ninjas. Fixed a bunch of bugs and finished content. It is now possible to drag people with you when phase jaunting/shifting. Jaunting/shifting should also kill livestock, huggers, and damage mechs. Renamed /obj/spell path to obj/proc_holder/spell in order to have a generic proc_holder category.

 Armor overhaul, phase 1. Armor protection rates are now handled by checking the var I added to obj/item/clothing instead of static percentile chances in the robusting code. What this means for the future is armors that differ in more than just bodyparts protected. Currently, all armors/helmets are running off the same set of protective values, which are roughly identical to the old hardcoded ones. a future phase will juggle these numbers around. What this means for right now: *Melee attacks to the chest/groin are slightly more likely to succeed than before. (80%-force block chance instead of 90%-force) *Bullets are slightly more likely to penetrate armor than before. (60% block/30% partial instead of 70%/40%) *Alien spit/e-crossbow bolts have a 10% chance of being blocked by armor. Lasers/Pulse Rifles/Tasers have unchanged values, as do melee head/arm/leg/hand/foot shots. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1561 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 #Beta: added code phrases for traitors which consist of the code phrase and the code response (which consist of a sequence of words). They are meant to flow into a regular conversation in the sequence provided. There is also a small chance that a traitor may not know either phrase or response, or both. For an example, let's say the phrase is: culture, wine, admit. The response is: massive, tired, doctor's delight. A traitor may begin a conversation with something like: "A man of culture always drinks wine, I must admit. What do you think?" The response to that: "When I am massively tired, I drink doctor's delight. Otherwise, I abstain." The example is best referenced in the Bar, or any place where drinks are available. With enough creativity and linguistical acumen, it may be used elsewhere. The point here is to make conversation seem as natural as possible while providing traitors a means to recognize each other. The words do no have to be exact, either. Quarter Master may be QM and the Captain may be Cap'n. Traitors should still recognize what is being communicated--or not. #Deactivated AI cores are no longer mobs. This is mostly cosmetic. You cannot gib a deactivated AI since it will be an object, not a mob. It will also not announce arrivals since it's an object, not a mob (this is an improvement, in my opinion). #Some code tweaks to AIs. They will now auto-start with a random name instead of their default-chosen name (which is still changeable). #Intelicards should no longer constantly refresh the window when they are being wiped. #Added new mech sprite. #Resin walls should no longer delete the person inside when killed in certain ways. Hulks will easily break free from resin if placed inside. #Ninjas can now download the AI onto spiderOS, provided Drain is on. SpiderOS works with AI cores, AI cards, and restoration terminals. Make sure Drain is on when you click on either the object (core/terminal) or the suit (aicard). AIs with law zero may get to have some fun, depending on circumstances. #Toggle Drain renamed to Toggle Interaction. It now serves as general trigger for special ninja interactions. #Added energy net power to ninjas. Prototype for HerpA and whatever he may want to do with it but it's pretty much finished. The energy net can be destroyed by the person trapped (or others) and will teleport them to the prison after 30 seconds. #Ninjas can now slice cameras apart per request. #Added a few more type checking procs (isliving, islarva, isobserver, ishivemainframe). #Mobs that are anchored will no longer be able to move (AIs will still move as normal). You will also not be able to grab them. #Incorporeal Move now works properly for regular mobs once more. #Marauders from CentCom can now launch directly from their bay.

 CHANGELOG && Dangercon Update: •Fireaxes, extinguishers and fireaxe closets placed around the station. Functionality described in changelog. Airlock modifying is because you can use the fireaxe to crank open doors. •Piano? Being able to be smashed? What are you talking about? •The two handed system is purely experimental and subject to much cleaning up/proc making to enable it for other objects as well. The mob modifications is because of the two handed system making it unable for you to switch hands. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1543 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Fixed PDA messaging. Fixed PDA flashlight. To clarify, you can still use the PDA when you are stunned/weakened. This was always the case, apparently. You cannot use the PDA when knocked out or dead. You can now stick an ID card into a PDA without clicking 400 times (click on PDA with card in hand). Changed how the ninja suit functions in relation to energy. It will now hold a power cell as APCs/Borgs/etc. Ninjas can now replace their starting power cell (reduced to high capacity/10000) with larger capacities. Drain the cell as normal to do it. On that note, hyper-capacity (30k) cells added to research. Can now drain energy from a recharger. Much like draining from wire. Added cooldown to certain ninja abilities. It is a global cooldown; meaning, most abilities will be unusable until it finishes. Usually a second. Some icon changes for ninjas. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1540 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Nuclear mode The nuke ops now spawn with normal names with one catch - their last names are the same (chosen by their boss). FIXED microwave's "S" balloon for syndies. Attention, microwave - TEST your code before you commit it. Revolution Most likely fixed the bug with cloned rev icons being reversed. Icons Added rev/headrev/syndie balloon sprites for holding in hand.

 hydroponics - Bananas can now be grown (they are now snack/grown/banana) - Sunflowers can now be grown and harvested (very limited use till I add in some seed recipes). Smack people with them for a unique message. - Both seeds are loaded into the seed vendor (for now), vendor is alphabetized. - New seeds added to either of the seed crates. - Move hydroponic items out of the weapon.dm and into hydroponics.dm Nuclear Agents - They have a little S symbol by their head now, that only other Agents can see. Other - Optical Material Scanners are blue goggles now, rather than a blind fold. Map update was just to update all the bananas on clown planet to the new "grown" item path. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1525 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Hydroponics Fixed a horrible bug with the replica pods grabbing non-dead players. Wizard Fixed a potential exploit with the teleport spell (object, of course). AIs Fixed another horrible bug of mine, where the death() proc doesn't process past a certain point. Glowshrooms Now drop to the floor when the walls nearby are destroyed. Biomass WIP added. Do NOT spawn them on live servers unless you want colors everywhere. Also my code is horrible and I should feel horrible. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1521 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Events Added a "lights out" event. Flashlights Red toolboxes now have only a 50% chance to spawn a flashlight (to add diversity and make the lights out event less easy to circumvent). Explosions Explosions are now round. This is quite a big balance change, so it's subject to change in the future. Hydroponics Hopefully fixed the bug with invading weeds etc being unharvestable. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1516 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Hydroponics Fixed bug with mutated plants not being harvestable. Added glowshrooms. They (maybe) glown in the dark. To get their seeds, you need to hack the seed machine. They're pretty straightforward. To plant a glowshroom on the floor, you need to click it while it's in your hand. Badmin Added a "Honk" button. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1515 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

Ore Box in cargo. then ore will be moved to ore box. - Mech fabricator build speed increased. - Mech fab queue updates through byjax. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1514 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Light floor added For non-coders: - Added floor lights - To build: Use wire on glass, use metal on the assembly you get, use it on a plating. To fix flickering or broken tiles, use a lightbulb on them. - To deconstruct: Crowbar on floor to remove it, crowbar on light tile to remove metal, wirecutters to separate the wire from the glass. - Click on tile with an empty hand to turn it on/off For coders: - The turf system has been rewritten to contain a tile variable which defines what kind of turf it is. The 'intact' var can no longer be used to determine if the turf is a steel floor. Intact only tells if wires and pipes are to be hidden (for hide() procs) - Use is_plating(), is_steel_floor() and is_light_floor() to determine the floor type. - Use make_plating(), make_steel_floor() and make_light_floor() to do this. They take the floor tile by default as a parameter, if none is given they will make one themselves. Credits for the sprites go to Hempuli, used with permission. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1513 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 - Fixed bug with destructive analyzer being stuck in busy state after canceling item destruction. - Fixed bug with mechs not reading ID permissions from PDA. - Updated H.O.N.K menu code. - There should be no delay in updating mech equipment info in exosuit stats window. - Added armor booster sprites. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1510 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Hydroponics Replica pods are now available for growing. They're limited to 3 seed packets, take 10 minutes to clone a human by default (ie if you don't breed them) and have a 70% chance to grow a plantman instead of a human (again, by default). To make the pod clone a human, you merely need to inject the seeds with his blood. Then, if he's dead by the time you harvest the pod plant, you'll clone him, otherwise it'll be an inert clone. Planting the seeds without injecting them with dna allows you to breed them so they're better, as they always result in one seed packet on harvest if there's no dna. Map Added an easter egg. Moved Kingston's cup to medbay. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1509 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Lethal injection needle, 50 units. Works like a normal syringe except for the following. Cannot draw blood. Takes 30 seconds to inject. Injects 50 units all at once. I've included one preloaded lethal injection needle into code for map builders to use, or for admins to spawn for testing in game. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1508 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 A couple of small changes before I tackle the buffing-up project. Luminosity Admins editing the luminosity var now properly uses sd_SetLuminosity(). Britcup A cup spawns for Kingston in hydroponics. Taser guns New sprites, courtesy of Arcalane. Now with an actual 4-shot gauge! Interface 16x16 mode re-enabled for shits and giggles. Mining Reverted the uranium ore sprite. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1507 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 - A hacked together pseudo-ajax. I called it byjax (byond+ajax). - Fixed a couple of nasty mech fabricator bugs. - Tweaked mecha status window. - Mecha equipment is now detachable (the command is in mecha "Equipment" menu). - Misc. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1506 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

If it's in the same area, you can leave control_area null. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1505 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Dangercon 2011 rebalancing - Maintenance Since I have to point out (as some are too thick to understand) not every single point listed below is intended to cause danger by itself, some are just to counteract points which by themselves cause either too much danger or too many annoyances... - Maintenance now contains a grand total of 3 fire suits - Maintenance shafts contain a grand total of 2 meson scanners - Shafts now contain 17 weld fuel tanks - Shafts now contain 10 water tanks - Shafts contain 14 gas masks, mostly located around the external exits... (You're welcome, syndicates) - Shafts contain empty closets for people to hide things in - Shafts don't contain a single fire closet - The rest of the items which they contain are extinguishers and such which are not noteworthy. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1503 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 - Attempted to straiten up some clothing dms - Finally got the NASA Jump suit to be spess worthy. Admins please don't spawn a billion of these. - Jumpsuits can now be used as spess suits if you add the flag "SUITSPACE" - Tower Caps are in the Hydro seed vending machine again, and you can get logs from them! - Sec's vending machine has 12 donuts by default, and can spit out 2 boxes of donuts if hacked. - Logs can to be sawed with a circular saw, makes two planks each. Otherwise can be used to get more seeds. - Planks can be formed into wooden objects, currently just wooden tables and wooden barricades. - Wooden barricades, they can be made from 5 planks. They cannot be moved once built. You can repair with more planks, and destroy them by bashing it (giving a few planks). - Wooden tables now deconstruct into wooden table parts (no more transmutation of wood to metal). - Plant scanner now lists water and nutriment level. - Ammonia, nutriment, and diethylamine are VERY good for plant nutrient. Other types of chemicals have been altered to be more effective. Sugar causes everything to grow, weeds and pests, and plants. Cryodone is very good to save plants from poison and death, water gives a 1:1 ratio for injection, soda water is very good for plants, nutriment now works on plants (it is a fertilizer), and radium properly kills your plants slightly. - Moved the wooden log to harvest DMI - Added some related semi place holder sprites for wooden tables, wooden planks, and wooden barricades git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1502 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 - Regular and fire first aid kits once again contain ointment. Apparently the info I got about ointment being broken was wrong, so ointment will remain. - Fixed two misplaced pipes in atmos, so hopefully the AI won't get endless atmos alerts a few dozen minutes into the game and will hopefully reduce atmos lag at round start. - Patient's locker should now contain the proper equipment. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1501 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Dangercon 2011 - Medbay rebalancing Code: - White wardrobe now called white wardrobe instead of medical wardrobe, contains 5 white jumpsuits and 5 white shoes, 1 placed in genetics for people without clothes. - Added patient's locker, works like personal lockers, contains 1x white jumpsuit, 1x white shoes (2 outside surgery, 1 in genetics) - Syringe box no longer has the "(biohazard alert)" in it's name, it's moved to the description. - Riot crates are once again orderable (unrelated bug fix) - NanoMed dispensers now only contain 4 spaceacilin dispensers each, 1 more placed in the examination room, 1 in virology - NanoMed dispensers now contain 4 beakers and 2 droppers - Security officers no longer spawn with mime gloves in their backpack - Medical locker now contains 2x inaproveline bottle, 2x antitox bottle, 1x syringe box, 2x dropper, 2x beaker. Removed supplies moved to tables and such. - anesthetic lockers now contain 3x anesthetic tank and 3x breath mask - Medical garb locker renamed to medical doctor's locker, contains a labcoat, white shoes, medical backpack, breath mask, medical cartridge, medical headset and medical belt. - CMO locker now contains a cmo jumpsuit instead of a medical one and no longer contains the air tank - Regular first aid now contains two kelotone pills instead of ointment - Fire first aid kits now contain an additional 2 kelotone pills instead of ointment (they contain 4 pills, 2x inaproveline syringe and an analyzer) Map: GENETICS: - Replaced empty closet with patient's closet which can be locked - Replaced genetics wardrobe closet with white wardrobe closet - Moved glasses box to clone room - Added a 2nd diskette box CMO Office - Added an emergency closet for aesthetic reasons MEDICAL STORAGE - Placed 3x sleep toxin bottle on the table - Placed 3x toxin bottle on the table - Removed all first aid kits - Placed glasses box on table - Old garb locker is now a MD Locker CHEMISTRY - Doubled the supplies intended for grenade making so they can make 4 grenades now (once their construction is fixed that is) - Added a third inaproveline bottle - Removed kelotone pill bottle - Added 2 empty pill bottles - Added a second dropper EXAMINATION ROOM - Removed latex glove box - Added inaproveline and antitox bottle on the table - Added 2x inaproveline syringe on the table - Added 1x spaceaciline syringe on another table - Added a MD's locker (replaced closet) SURGERY READY ROOM - Replaced 2 closets with 2 patient's lockers - Removed medical mask box. MEDBAY LOBBY - Now contains 2x fire first aid. - Now contains 2x toxin first aid. - Now contains 3x regular first aid. - Contains 1 inaproveline, 1 antitox, 1 tox and 1 sleep tox bottle - Contains a few inaproveline syringes, empty ones and boxed ones on tables around. - Contains only one latex glove box and an extra set of gloves on a table - Removed antitox pill bottle. As with the r1490, please post any concerns or opinions you have. Try to be a bit more constructive this time. Generally if you were not able to keep score on what got removed and what got added, there is now less of all bottled medicine, but considering noone used the one that was locked away in medical lockers, it is not much more accessible and with that, more useful. There is the same number of medikits around, just placed in different areas and there is generally the same amount of stuff around, but it's easier to get to for non-medical personnel. The only serious nerf that I am aware of is the reduction of spaceacilin, but there are still 9 syringes in medbay, despite that. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1497 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Suits: - Suit properties are better organized (so they can be clearly/ quickly read and edited). - Fat People can wear All robes, lab coats, aprons, suspenders and the hazard vest. - Radiation suit has a heat transference of .30 now, 1000 protective temperature, gas transfer coefficient of 0.90. Reason, it may be made with lead, but it isn't a fire suit that also has radiation protection. - Chef Apron has heat transference and permeability at .50. Reason, it will make it slightly harder to heat up, and it keep you from getting sick better than wearing nothing to shield you from germs. Just minor little tweaks, nothing important overall. Unless you enjoy being a fat doctor or chef a lot. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1496 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Dangercon 2011 update: - I agree that setting up as engineer is a pain, so engineers will now start out with a utility belt with everything from a mechanical toolbox in it (except for the analyzer) and a piece of wire in it. For the moment this spawns in their hand due to traitor assignment requiring the PDA to be in the belt slot. - Engineers now also spawn with a hardhat on - Hardhats removed from engineers lockers - A hardhat has been placed on the rack with the fire suit for a HoP-assigned engineers. - Utility belts on the racks reduced from 6 to 2 - Placed two empty syringes in hydroponics - Deleted all blob spawns and placed them again in hopes that they actually cause some damage now... git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1492 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Added HoS (58), HoP (57) and CE (56) access levels. The HoP level applied to the HoP's locker, the CE access level applied to CE's locker and office door, the HoS' access level applied to HoS office door and locker. Each of these heads spawns with only their own access level: Consequences: - They cannot enter eachother's office (Except for HoP's office, which retains heads/bridge access) - They cannot steal eachother's stuff so easily - The borg blowing console is safe from the HoP's ugly fingers - The hypospray is also safe from the HoP's fingers. (Both only until he grants himself full access, obviously) - Commit includes commented out ion storm code and not-commented-out ion_act procs. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1485 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Two new microwave recipes: - Tele Bacon: Requires one piece of meat and a remote signaler. It is delicious and may allow people to teleport to your location. - Banana Phone: Requires a banana, a radio, and 5 units of psilocybin. Basically an edible radio. Eat at your own risk (MAY CAUSE HOMICIDAL URGES, NOT LIKE THAT IS ANYTHING UNUSUAL). On a totally unrelated note: - Banana Phone (full version of the song, not the short loop version) can now be played via the "Banana Phone" fun admin command. It only runs once. - Fixed a potential runtime error in the juicer code. DRINKS! - Potato juice added, produced from putting a potato in a juicer. - 10 Potato Juice + 2 Enzyme = Vodka - 5 coffee + 5 sugar + 2 enzyme = Kahlua git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1484 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Replaced the 1 tile thick tables on the map with the updated set, committed in the previous revision. Also deleting map versions 2.0.3 - 2.0.6 due to them not being used anymore.

 Fixed bugs: Players now cannot rejoin the game if their mobs were gibbed/burned while they were disconnected. Cremating/gibbing for meat now counts as death with triggering log records, gamemode checks, sql reports, etc. Fixed some bugs with enabling verb ghostize(). Fixed bug with DNA Machine popping out from the protolathe. Fixed bug with tuning RSD. Added juicer: berry -> berry juice banana -> banana juice tomato -> tomato juice carrot -> carrot juice Bug your botanists for getting better potence for more juice. Juicer can be pulled, chef can give it to barmen or botanists. Blender changed a bit: tomato -> ketchup corn -> corn oil soy beans -> soy milk any food -> nutriments and contained reagents. Sound for the juicer found at http://www.freesound.org/samplesViewSingle.php?id=98053, edited by Nikie. You can eject ingredients from the microwave. However, you cannot get back your reagents, they will be lost and can make microwave dirty. Essence of Banana was renamed to Banana Juice. Added Carrot Juice. Heals eyes much slower than imidazoline. Carrots now contain imidazoline (however, carrot cake contains more imidazoline). Potency for peppers, tomatoes, carrots and druggy mushrooms should work now. New cocktail "Bahama mama": 2 rum, 2 orangejuice, limejuice, ice. Changed recipe for soy sauce: 4 soy milk + 1 acid. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1477 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Yes, I forgot the final tie that mangled medical and research together. I speak of the research director's head set having a medical channel. It is removed now. The RD hasn't been a medical staff member for a long time now, BECUSE SHE IS A RESARCH DIRECTOR! She is not the CMO. Now then. As it stand now from my two radio headset updates: - Medsci personnel have medical and science channels. - Roboticists have a science channel. - The RD is now focused on the science channel, so she can keep better tabs on the various people she is Directing, for research. All the research departments can talk to each other now, and say things like "Chemist, bring some acid to robotics" or "Chemist, set some acid out for R&D" or "Hey R&D, I need some mech boards". So yeah. RD looses medical channel on her head set. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1475 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Object Spell System v1.12 Added trigger spell, which basically activates two or more spells at once. Used that to fix fireball and blind to what they were pre-change (not code-wise, but the same for the end user). Projectiles aren't limited to default spells now. All spells now use a user argument (=usr by default) instead of usr. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1474 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Radios: Beacon - gives slight blue space research. Heads sets - > CE - Removed mining channel, they really didn't need it. > QM and HoP - Added back their mining channel, as they DID need it. > HoP - starts with Security channel turned off, and mining channel turned off (only cargo bay and command are on) > NEW MEDSCI HEADSETS! Has medical and science channels. > Robotics - Now has science channel (for the RD to yell at them). Jobprocs: Medsci heads sets given to chemist, geneticists and virologists. So they can now be bugged by the RD and other research folks. Research Designs: - Removed Gold and silver picks (I do recall Neo saying they didn't make any sense, but he made them just so there would be layering between normal picks and diamond picks). + Added Sonic Jackhammer, drill, plasma cutter, and diamond drill. + Added tracking beacon, it is a blue space items. Modules Robot: Updated due to jackhammer update in mining. Mining: Jackhammer - renamed Sonic Jackhammer (due to using silver wiring, which is used in harmonic electronics). + Mining Drill - It is the same speed as jackhammers, but is a drill and made of different stuff. Plasma cutter - Changed tech requirement and dropped the speed to 20. Turbo Drill - renamed Diamond Mining Drill, has a dig speed now of zero (meaning it makes walls just crumble). Costs a lot of materials and is decently difficult to research. Sprites: Diamond mining drill, for the item of the same name. Jackhammer is redesigned to fit its new name. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1473 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Updated xeno ability code. Updated ninja ability code. Misc ninja update. Fixed chemistry reagent code for the ninja suit. This final update could have been more awesome but whatever.

 Cleaned up a few lines of unnecessary alien code. Cleaned up mob projectile code a bit so it uses switch. It's now much harder to play punch-out with a xeno, unless you're the hulk. Xenos can now stick humans and monkeys into resin walls. Inside a resin wall, the person cannot escape unless the wall is destroyed (there is a 5% they will crawl out on their own). They are also paralyzed and cannot suicide. Robots will now spark when you clobber or shoot them. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1467 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Object spell system v1.1 Completely revamped the classes, it's even more streamlined now. Got a few bugs and tweaks (namely, blind doesn't work, fireball got buffed up as compensation for not dealing additional damage to the target), but it's okay, since nobody uses those anyway. Fixed the bug with emagged borg laws. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1465 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Fixed runtime error with changeling gibbed by alium larva. Added sanitize() to naming the buffers in DNA machine and to alien whispering. Added 0.5 sec timeout for BANG BANG. Added drinking glasses to the Dinnerware vending machine. Update from Nikie: Verb Reload Admins rereads admins.txt Parameter sql_enabled in config. Prevents spam when sql is not installed. NOTE FOR HOSTERS: it is currently ON in code (i.e. behavior is unchanged yet), you have to add SQL_ENABLED to your config.txt during next week. Thanks for your attention. Fixed "Delay" command.

 Fixed SpiderOS chemical injections to work a lot better. Thanks to Muskets and Darem. Added a new reagent proc (trans_id_to) to transfer a specific reagent from a list to the target. Finished SpiderOS. If anyone plans to revise PDA code, or maybe do something similar, I highly recommend looking at the SpiderOS verb first. Ninjas may now drain energy from exposed wires, ala a powersink. It takes longer than APCs to begin charging and drains slower. Misc bug fixes and improvements. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1460 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Glorious Return Update: - Adjusted OnConsume proc in food so that it occurs before the check to see if the item is finished (so that you can do triggers whenever you take a bite rather then only when it's completely eaten). Adjusted existing food items so that they still work the same. - Eating popcorn now has a random chance of having the user accidentally bite on an un-popped kernel. This doesn't do anything other then give the user a message though. - Kabobs now return the bar used to make them. - New atom flag: NOREACT. Reagents stored in objects, mobs, and turfs that have this flag do not react. Right now, only the microwave and mobs have this effect (only mobs had this effect before). It's intended to simplify devices that use reagents. ADMIN NOTE: You can remove this flag from people if you feel like being a dick. - NOREACT flag automatically gets removed on death. (Commented out for now) - Removed a flag on certain mobs that wasn't actually doing anything. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1459 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 - Wirecutters have a 50% chance of changing to the yellow sprite - Upon spawn, the screwdriver picks between 7 colors - Electrical toolboxes now have a 5% chance of spawning with insulated gloves in them. (I did my maths, there are 12 electrical toolboxes on the station, this means only one of them will contain the gloves about once every two rounds) Most of these toolboxes are in protected areas anyway. (Part of DangerCon 2011) Mapping: - Tech storage now contains a pair of insulated gloves. (DangerCon 2011) - There is now an oxygen canister near disposal, in emergency storage and the CE's office. Toxins has a toxin canister near the maintenance access, the incinerator has two toxin canisters and two oxygen canisters again, the construction site north of robotics has a small plasma tank. (All part of DangerCon 2011) - Notices about financial cuts (announcing the removal of tools, equipment and supplies as determined by Dangercom 2011) now spawn on all heads' desks - Wooden tables now look nicer - git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1455 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 #Added mechs as chargables for ninjas. #Private lockers can now be sliced open with the ninja sword. #Added a SpiderOS verb to the ninja suit when initialized. It acts as a lite PDA with some unique features. If I had more time, I would revise the existing PDA system to follow the format of SpiderOS which would make the former run a lot faster. #Added an adrenaline boost ability for the ninja suit. It will near instantly remove paralysis/stun/etc but has only three uses. #Added ninja stars ability. Ranged projectiles, the user randomly picks a target from nearby living enemies. Projectile itself is wip. #Maximum charge for the suit is 30000, or 300%. #More names for ninja name gen. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1451 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Shitton of bugfixes related to bryteloss/fireloss. Note for coders: in order to help with seaching of health-related bugs I have moved many procs from /mob/ under /mob/living/. Also, done some clean up and rearranging. Results: -admin rejuvenating now works again; -people screams if getting creamated while still alive; -diseases actually loose your health; -monkeys wearing masks receive protection from acids as humans did; -and other minor fixes and improvements.

 PDA carts: Janitor Bucket now PROPERLY shows the maximum of the bucket as 100 on the PDA. Yay for accuracy! Mops and cleaners: Made the space cleaner bottles contain less units of material overall (250), however only spray 5 units at a time (you get 50 shots now). Makes it MUCH easier to refill with spess cleaner. Especially now that the ammonia and water reaction give more output. In other news, MOPS ARE MAGNETS TO ME! Sorry Chicago Ted, I tried to make it less awkward, but it did not want. RSF: Items appear on floors properly now! Chemistry Reagents: Sugar/ sodas - less nutrition per unit. Sugar - No more jitters =( adminordrazine - More OP, but it is admin/ sandbox only anyway. Arithrazine - Sets radiation damage to 0, because it is the dexalin plus of anti-radiation meds. Hyronalin - Stronger radiation removal Chem recipes: Space cleaner - 2 units per reaction now.

 A Big Kitchen Update. A new powerful microwave code allows completely new recipes. All cooked food all have transferred in all the reagents which ingredients had (except of nutriments). A new neat food sprites from Farart. New/changed recipes for cooking with microwave: - Berry Pie was replaced with Berry Clafoutis with new sprite. Recipe: 2 flour, 1 egg, 2 berries (not berryjuice); - Fortune cookies: 1 flour, 1 egg, piece of paper with prophecy; - Meat stake: 1 unit of salt, 1 unit of black pepper, 1 slab of meat; - Pizza "Margherita": 2 flour, 4 wedges of cheese, 1 tomato; - Meat Pizza: 2 flour, 2 slabs of meat, 1 wedge of cheese, 1 tomato; - Mushroom Pizza: 2 flour, 5 any mushrooms; - Vegetable Pizza: 2 flour, 1 eggplant, 1 carrot, 1 corn, 1 tomato; - Spacy Liberty Duff: 10 units of water, 5 units of vodka, 3 Liberty Caps; - Amanita Jelly: 5 units of water, 10 units of vodka, 3 Amanitas; - Meatball Soup: 20 units of water, 1 meatball (aka faggot), 1 carrot, 1 potato; - Vegetable Soup: 20 units of water, 1 carrot, 1 corn, 1 eggplant, 1 potato; - Meatball Soup: 20 units of water, 1 meatball (aka faggot), 1 carrot, 1 potato; - Nettle Soup: 20 units of water, 1 nettle, 1 egg, 1 potato; - Hot Chili stew: 1 slab of meat, 1 chili pepper, 1 tomato; - Cold Chili stew: 1 slab of meat, 1 ice pepper, 1 tomato; Other bugfixes: Fixed items showing under vendomats/microwaves.

 #Fixed a few items not being examinable when on the hud. #Most ninja suit abilities will not be available unless the suit is initialized (such as stealth and the alike). #Ninja suit now comes with a basic energy system. It begins with 10000 and depletes 5 energy/tick. Having an energy blade depeletes +20 energy. Having stealth active depelets +25 energy. #Ninjas start with 10 smoke bombs. When used they are gone forever. #Other abilities now require and use energy. #Recovering energy is possible by clicking on APCs with an empty hand, ~1000e/5 seconds. There is no battery energy limit. Plan to add more ways to get energy later. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1438 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 #Fixed swat armor from previous commit, oops. #Added effects and sounds to ninja powers. #Energy blade will no longer cut through r-walls. Regular walls take seven seconds to cut through. #Added a bare-bones startup and power-down system to the ninja suit (and accessories). It will need to initialize before granting powers. It should be very possible to give anyone the suit and turn them into a space ninja. Just make sure to edit their special_role to "Space Ninja" #This also means that ninja items are now removable before they are initialized (or after de-initializing). Suit and mask are still not examinable due to a mysterious bug with obj verbs. #fixed a few misc bugs. #Updated turrets a tad. You can now destroy them by bashing them with stuff when they pop out. If someone feels up to it, death commandos need a cool helmet to go with their new suits. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1437 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Lexorin - now deadly, dealing -3 oxygen loss a tick. I play tested, and it seems to work pretty fast while still possible to get healed if you reach a medibot or a doctor with dexalin. You make a "GASP" a chance of 10% a tick. Dexalin (and dexalin plus) - counteracts Lexorin, removing 2 units per tick. Bilk - you can drink it and get drunk finally. It shares the same effects of a beer and a milk. And sounds as good as it tastes, GOD AWEFUL. Sugar - gives some nutriment from being eaten. Tasty! Space twinkies will now finally work to make you fat. Metroid Jam - added a "return" after its "..()" due to complaints that drinking a whole jar did nothing (which could just be good luck). git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1434 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 #Fixed ninja teleporting. It will not blackscreen when Phase Jaunting near the map edge. #Phase Shift will no-longer show up in the Ninja verb panel. You can right-click on turfs only to use it. #Ninjas can now spawn a sword in their active hand. Besides killing dudes, it's also useful for slicing through doors, lockers, walls, and so on. It'll disappear if dropped or thrown, and it cannot be placed in containers. #Ninja mask now works differently when mimicking voice. You start out as "Unknown" and when toggling the voice changer it will randomly change your name with some variations. #If you switch the name back to "Unknown" you will re-active voice masking which is much less silly this time. The only way for someone to determine your true name is to remove the mask. Postmodern Space Bushido demands that you only reveal your identity in honorable combat! #Slightly updated sprites for ninja suit and accessories. Or as I'd like to call them, the Tron suit. Probably wip until I get enough motivation to redo it from scratch. #People that respawn as death commandos are now manually chosen by an admin. #Death commandos use the new suit sprites. #Added a global proc for animations.

Also, changed the name of the hand held mining drill from gigadrill (the name of a proposed self-propelling vehicular mining drill from way back when which may or may not get completed) to handdrill in the sprite and Turbo Drill in the defines in order to prevent any possible conflicts or confusion. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1425 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Did the person who made the armored security cyborg side sprites ever look at the original sprites at any point? Where are ANY of the traits you tried to imprint on it indicated in any fashion? And why the pelvis thrusting out? Why the shoe change? Why did you change the eye overlays so they would no longer have any directionality?

 DangerCon Update: - Fire will now melt through floors when it reaches a certain temperature. Technical info: - Floors have a heat capacity of 10000 degrees, once a fire gets hotter than that, it will set the turf's 'to_be_destroyed' variable to 1. It also updates a variable which shows how much fire-induced temperature a turf has had to sustain. Once the fire burns up, it will check if the turf's (loc's) to_be_destroyed variable is not 0, if it is it will calculate the chance for it getting destroyed (foruma in hotspot's del proc) and either replace it with space or not, depending on the probability result. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1405 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Tweaked welding: Welders that are on but not in use use fuel more slowly than before, when actively welding, fuel use rate increases to roughly 4 times what the previous rate was. This allows for an average of 4 regular walls to be cut through before refueling is needed, based on my testing. Shorter-length welding tasks will allow for more uses between refuels. Also cleaned up a few things that still used the "click welder at thing, lose x units of fuel" code. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1403 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 - Mech Fabricator can be built. Contruction path is almost the same as for lathes, but you'll require 2 Matter Bins, 1 Manipulator, 1 Micro-Laser and 1 Console Screen. - Added design for mech fabricator circuitboard. - Added origin_tech for some mech equipment. - Examining mecha chassis will show what construction step you're currently on. - Made Gygax construction reversible. - Moved global_iterator.dm and construction_datum.dm to code/datums/helper_datums - Split mecha_construction.dm into mecha_parts.dm and mecha_construction_paths.dm - Fixed wrong logic for mecha dna-checks. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1402 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

Arrivals now has one more tables, and chairs are closer to the tables. Overall, I tried to make it look more... comfortable? I mean it has a rug and stuff. Mech bay has two more borg chargers, because people needed more of them! BEEPSKY IS BACK. People have complained for months, admin and player alike, but the law is back. Beep O' Sky got drunk, but admins could find him again if they really want to. Finally, someone accidentally deleted (I hope) the bad ass plasma cutter sprite that Vtec made. And that was just cruel.

 Seizure man has laying down sprites now. The other thing has... well just an extra copy of a sprite that is relabeled. Map: Engine latticing looks nicer. And the engine is now symmetrical, and without unessessary area parts under single tools. Added the ban hammer toy in a secret part of the map. Added a few high voltage signs by SMES batteries.

 A lot of unnecessary r-walls removed around the station (such as in maintenance tunnels or around robotics.) If it wasn't an office and it wasn't guarding something extremely dangerous, r-walls were taken away.

To turn on wizards spawning with an spellbook that gives object spells as opposed to verb spells, uncomment the FEATURE_OBJECT_SPELL_SYSTEM line in config.txt For the end user, the vanilla (without spell var editing) wizard, the only two differences are having to click spells to use them (not being able to right-click stuff and cast spells that way or type them in the command line) and having a nice little countdown for a spell's recharge time.

 Arcade prize update: Arcade prizes are now looking VERY REAL (as both of the head coders wanted them to look real again). Toy E-swords sound real when you turn them on/off. New toy! The replica red spess suit! Great for costume parties, not great for keeping security from chasing you down the hall, or space travel. Made of real plastic! Now no one can bitch about the Ai satilite's teleporter suits. `~` git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1378 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 MAP REVERTED TO 1373 DUE TO COMPILE ERRORS (Someone committed a map which had those "<<<<<< mine" tags indicating a conflict) MAP IS NOW 2.0.7 Map updates: - Xenobiology access level applied to xenobiology. - Xeno pen's blast doors are now under the windows and grilles. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1377 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Changed the void helmet mob sprites a bit. The rim around the visor is more red than before so the effect of the sudden appearance of one is less startling. Map changed to remove the walls and grills and flooring around the singularity engine. Replaced with scattered scaffolding. The engine was eating the floors every time, growing much faster, and would rapidly consume all of the walls and such around it to get to unshrinkable size in practically an instant. That's not balanced. Plus it was ugly anyway. Syndicate suits returned to AI satellite teleporter room to prevent metagaming among the crew. Voidsuits given to miners instead. This also means there's less rig suits, so that traitor objective is significantly less trivial. Due to the proximity of the map updates and my inability to open Microwave's map once it was downloaded because of errors, none of her changes are on this one. I need sleep. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1374 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Due to popular demand. Slightly more defined glasses are back. The old thin bar sprites are relabeled to denote their thinness. Also, MAP UPDATE: Because people whine about illegal syndicate suits no longer spawning on Nanotrasen property (the AI Satellite teleporter), red suits will be found all over in spess! The derelict has two, one at the Vag station engine room (because that was a popular syndicate target), and one at the old AI room (which I assume was also a top target). Some flavor text was added (little papers by the bodies showing what objective they had to do). Ruskie DJ station now has their Red Suit on a rack in solars SMES room. Abandoned shuttle has evidence of a wizard attack, and two sets of syndicate red suits (what were they doing up there that pissed a wizard off that much?). git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1373 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 MAP updated: - Moved the AI satellite teleporter a few tiles to the right so jumping north from it will make you miss the abandoned station by 2 tiles. Intended to prevent non-engineer borgs from getting to the satellite. - Placed a single normal wall tile on the AI satellite so the AI is not in direct LOS from the door. (did a lot of testing with this and it usually resulted in a much better fight to kill the AI) - Added Superxpdude's lobby (Slightly edited) http://tgstation13.servehttp.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=2693 - Fixed lattice not being connected to the solars shields - Connected north arrivals hallway maintenance with the law office maintenance. - Slight rewiring around the law office area. The area now gets power from the arrivals power line which comes through the newly created pass. - Removed the rogue lattice in the engine - Slight aesthetic touch-ups in the medbay and science area. - The xenobiology pen now requires RD access. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1372 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Reverted ninja stealth so it works again. Ninjas now explode when they die. Ninja mask obscures speech (garbles text) if the voice modulator is not set to mimic voice. Ninja hood makes one not trackable by AI if worn, much like the agent card. Certain obj/item/clothing items (canremove=0) will not be removable by normal means. Currently only set for ninja stuff and the suicide vest. The suicide vest might explode if active and someone tries to strip it off a person. Removed heat protection from black shoes. Not sure why it was there. Removing a mask from a monkey via text window will now properly give a message. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1370 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Broborg and Service borg are fused into one robust little critter. Broborgs commented out. Service borgs lose paper and spacecash wad. Service borg gets an RSF. Rapid service fabricator, with three setting that work on simulated (normal) floors and tables: 1. Creates a wad of 10 Credits (because humans like dosh). Drains 200 each use. 2. Creates a drinking glass (to fill beer into). Drains 50 energy each use. 3. Creates a Piece of paper (for writing). Drains 10 energy each use. The malfunction lockers use new, robust (read as slightly nerfed), 2001 a Spess Odyssey spess suits. (Due to voting results) No 2001 jetpacks though, as they don't have item states. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1369 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Satchel returned to a cleaned up version of the old sprite. Bananium ore now looks like the other ores, inspiration drawn from the plasma ore. Refined bananium is a gem, and more symmetrical than the previous version of that sprite. Shovel head is a shovel head based on an actual real shovel used to move coal and dirt in mines and not a spade head used for breaking ground in gardens. Jackhammer handles more solid-looking. Consolidated the pick sprites. Upgraded picks have only one point to differentiate their silhouettes. Separate sprites for the detached heads provided, as per the original intention of the one who was coding the research path. Sprites also added for pickaxe heads made of plasma crystal and uranium, which are about as rare as silver or gold, but not obtainable at the start of the round and make slightly more sense as mining heads than the soft, decorative metals. Plus rule of cool says a uranium mining pick is better. Jackhammer in hand sprite (which shouldn't exist, since jackhammers are for cyborgs) changed to more accurately reflect what the jackhammer obj icon looks like. All pick in hand sprites changed to reflect how the pick obj icons look. In hand icons added where needed. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1368 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Mapping fixes near arrivals. - Removed camera "Arrivals Extra Docking" and replaced with "Arrivals Auxiliary Docking" in a better location. AI can now see all arrivals airlocks and also has a better view of disposal. Also a bit easier to get around if you're using the keyboard arrows. - Added camera "Delivery Office" to the mailroom.

 BORG VISION MODE UPDATE Added three new items for use in borg modules. Meson Vision Thermal Vision X-Ray Vision When selected as an active module (as in it is taking up one of your three module slots, not that it is your "in-hand" module), the module confers the appropriate vision mode. These vision modes consume a lot of power while active (50/tick on meson, 100/tick on thermal, 200/tick on xray), so it's best to keep them inactive unless you need them. Gave Meson vision to mining and engineering borgs, did NOT hand out Thermal or Xray vision, that won't happen until I get an idea of public opinion on this update. Also included is a syndicate borg module that's been sitting half-finished in my local copy of the code as I was having issues deciding what all to give it. It is NOT selectable at this time. The plan was for it to only be selectable under specific conditions, most likely involving hacking and/or emagging. It's only getting committed because its in the same file as the actual update. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1359 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Minor fix on Aug's fixing of that compile warning (which was the third commit to fix it, apparently people don't like warnings in their compiles, even if it doesn't interfere with anything).

 I did one thing today. I upgraded the chemical in liberty caps to be more robust in making people freak the hell out (rather than copy pasta spess drug code). It works at an incline, the more you put into someone, the stronger the effects. All carbon lifeforms now will start to see ghosts when they have enough of the liberty cap reagent in them. As a unavoidable bug, they will also see cloaked people, due to how see invisibity works. But they will be too stoned out of their minds to do anything, me thinks. Spess Tea now make you jitter less, because it is meant to calm people down. Clown burgers now have 8 nutriment points, and a minor typo fix on the Fillet o Carp sandwich. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1353 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 The damage zone selector bit should properly highlight the groin when you have it targeted. Apparently the cat ears gimmick item were supposed to match the hair color of the owner. So they do now.

 Since people complained at me about not being able to shoot people in the face anymore due to my revolver nerf (also that point-blank shooting at people on the ground accomplishes fuckall since the bullet passes over them), I have made bullets and lasers and the like able to be aimed at places other than the chest. Much like in melee combat, aiming for a bodypart other than the chest is NOT a guarantee that you will hit said bodypart. Helmets protect against shots to the head, and armor protects against shots to whatever body parts the armor is coded to cover. Also I made the revolver point-blank shot work on people on the ground. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1350 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 When ninjas teleport into a living mob(s), that mob is gibbed. HIYA Added emp pulse to ninjas powers (Ninja gear is not affected by EMP). Ninja mask protects against flash (portable and set).

 I hate special snowflakes update~ Assorted items no longer have special snowflake attack() code that lets them bypass the base attack() proc stun/KO chances. This mostly affected guns of assorted varieties, and was done mainly due to the fact that the code was both outdated and based on the horribly overpowered revolver code (which got commented out ages ago). If you want specifics, the only way to protect yourself from the special snowflake code is to be an admin and manually set the bitflag on your headgear to include the "8" bitflag, which was the "protects your head" bitflag in ancientcode. This was even if the attack wasn't actually targeting the head. Aside from that, there was also the problem that this special snowflake code left targets incapacitated for FAR longer than the base attack() proc would (60 ticks of life() for the pre-nerf revolver, 10-120 ticks for the energy gun). And again, this was with no way to protect yourself aside from being an admin and modifying the vars on your headgear. Harmbatons, Harmtasers, and Death Nettles got to keep their snowflake code, but I modified it so you only get stunned if the attack makes it past any armor you're wearing. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1346 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Space ninjas are now a thing that is in the game. Admin spawned only at the moment under fun, usable by host/Game Master. They don't come with any special powers (besides kickass equipment and being a ninja, c'mon) but I'll probably add some later. They are immune to facehuggers. I've also divided their suit into parts as outlined in some topic I forgot about. When ninjas spawn, they start in a location for space carp (in space).

 God... I went though a lot of cloths. In Gimmick, Santa suit now is pretty quick (but it can't spawn in game so fat chance of using it). Typo fix, description changes. In head, A few descriptions changes. Jumpsuits, Chemists and the CMO have their OWN jump suits now. So no one can confuse the chemist in chemistry with a geneticist. Added a space Jumpsuit to the code, it can only be spawned by admins or people in sand box. So you can jump out an air locks with it now (default sprite is a black jumpsuit). Fixed the roboticists jump suit so the head transfer coefficient is lower (as some One set it to the same level as a lab coat for some insane reason, lucky we don't have more frozen people in robotics). Miner jump suits are a fraction better against heat transfer than other jump suits, but just slightly. In Suits Tacticool NASA Voidsuit, which is just like a Red space suit but can only hold energy guns, are slower (slightly) and are bulky (so you can't hide them in back packs). Also, a few description changes. Perhaps now we can add these to the AI satellite teleporter room? Maybe? Job Procs Chemist and CMO start with above stated jumpsuits for their job ranks. Flamethrower Gives 1 weapons and 1 plasma research. This was something the creator of the R&D had not gotten around to doing (when questioned about it a while back, he wanted it to give minor tech fields in both, but got busy), so I just want to lighten the load.

 Sprite updates: Miner Cyborg looks better. Better jackhammer (I like it at least). New sink for kitchen Few sprite fixes for the emergency oxygen tanks Cyborg's RED eyes, will not work now. Code Stuffs: Adding some code for mining so I can eventually make the top tier mining items work for radius mining. Showers are in their begining stages. Tool boxes give weapons research bonus, of 1 (lol, tool boxers). Map Stuffs: Added a few more hazard signs. Added enclose the engine (still airless). Kitchen has new sink. I desided the dispencer should be a water dispencer in the mine station. Barely worked on the wizard's lair, just added lights I guess. More colored clothing lockers in locker room/ arrivals shuttle. Now expect to see green wearing assitants. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1315 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 I'm not entirely sure how or why ghosting broke, but it should work again. My testing indicated that attempting to ghost via the verb wasn't even calling the proc.

 MMI update the third and fourth. Barring some big huge bug that didn't turn up in my testing to make sure shit works, the MMI is ready for showtime. If you're wondering why updates third and fourth happened together, in update the third I redid how brains work, and I was halfway to committing it when I realized "wait, if I upload this now, everything that uses the brain will cause fuckups". Notable changes: When your brain is cut out, instead of your client hanging around inside your now brainless and more or less useless body, it it shunted into the brain object, similar to an AI in an intellicard. While not in an MMI, your brain is "dead", deathchat and all. When stuck into an MMI, you spring to 'life', allowing you to talk to whoever stuck your brain into the thing. It occurs to me while I'm typing this up that it would be very easy to abuse this communication between life and death by slapping brains in and out of MMIs. DO NOT DO THIS OR THE ADMINS WILL HATE YOU AND DO MEAN THINGS TO YOU. Life in an MMI is pretty boring, so you should yell at people until they stick you into an AI core or robot frame to give you something to do. I know the MMI was originally thought up as a mecha interface, but I haven't gotten around to looking at the mecha code to figure out how to hook it in yet. I suspect there's going to be howls of "WHY DO YOU HATE ROBOTICISTS" over this next part, but the MMI itself is an R&D-researched object, with a biotech level of 3. That said, the station starts with two of them in the operating room (to get the research level up if nothing else), and they are producible at the protolathe AND the mecha fabricator (since they will eventually get to plug into a mecha.) Known issues: The MMI is SUPPOSED to pop out of a cyborg with the player attached when the cyborg goes pop, but it didn't in my initial testing, simply ghosting the borg as they already do. Will work on this as I have time, but what with having to go to work these days, I have somewhat less of that. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1311 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 WELDING UPDATE: - Welders no longer double charge for time AND work. If anyone wants to fight about it I'll take you all on and beat you up with a tool box. - Large Tank Industrial Welders now spawn in the weld closet, and can be hacked out of autolathes, they hold 40 units of fuel. - Two new welders, the HUGE one that'll be in the prolathe construction later, and the experimental one that'll have regenerating fuel. MONKEY BUG FIX: - Monkey modules code changed so monkeys's back packs appear properly. Like people do, without me committing a billion duplicate back sprites. - Monkeys have more masks to wear. - Monkey gas masks have a north facing sprite now. - Monkey Module code changed so MASKS will always work proper. Mining Update: - Plasma Cutter and sprites. It cuts at a delay of 0. meaning it is the best of the best of the best in the mining of ores. SIR! Thanks to VtecJumper, who happened to have it on his signature!

 Part two of MMI update: you can now beat on them to damage and/or kill the brain within. Health analyzers can check the health of the brain.

 Started work on a man-machine interface for use in cyborg/AI creation (and possibly mecha piloting), instead of straight brain usage. Currently, the MMI is adminspawn-only, and all you can do is slap a brain into it, Allowing the brain's owner to talk at you. Currently, an MMIbrain is entirely immortal.

But I doubt they will give pause before smoking the last ones. 5)Suit storage is now used when you spawn! Pen lights in pocket, and guns in armor.

Made the warden slightly less robust than his boss, and get hand cuffs, and no FLASHBANGS. I hate those things! Their gun is now a taser at the start. All security members have a pair of latex gloves in their back packs for deal with with evidence, if they recall to put them on. Miner lockers have MESON SCANNERS! And.. Miner rank jumpsuits...

 Mapping: - reverted to 2.0.5 map - re-added vault (since some 135deg wires were used instead of 90deg ones, I'd just like to say that I'm not really worried about which set is used, just so long as the entire power-net is wired in the same way. If you want 90deg wires, please re-wire the entire station. Consistency is important in game design.) - Fixed wiring through the vault which made the bridge and other areas loose power - Added some generic stuff to the vault. New access: - fixed the ID computer to include both mint accesses, vault access and mining station access. The latter two are new. QM doesn't have mining station access (so he can't access EVA and the production areas on that station) HoP has them tho. Other: - Vault doors are now opaque, so you can't see through them. Hoping vey will add the missing icon states asap. - You can now manually add coins into the money bag (also fixed poor money bag interaction window formatting) git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1236 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 The great verb retabbening. Assigned categories to assorted verbs that lacked them. Commands tab is now more or less gone. Instead, things are in "IC" for things like say, whisper, me, that are inherent to you, "OOC" for things like OOC chat, and "Objects" for verbs originating from the world around you. I suppose for those non-admins in the audience, you now also get an "Admin" tab, because I stuffed adminhelp and adminwho in there. This change was only to verbs defined as verbs in the code, procs that are assigned to things as verbs are far more numerous and harder to isolate, but also mostly admin-related. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1234 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Cyborg at round start count dropped to 2 (with 10 votes) as per thread discussion. The winning vote (with 12 votes) was actually for 1 cyborg, but I feel this was made as overcompensation for the recent levels since there was little real argument in the thread discussion itself. Besides, it seems 2 cyborgs gives the AI something it hasn't had in AI Malfunction rounds in ages -- a fair shake. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1233 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Bibling a corpse no longer spams the fuck out of the hit noise. Also, I looked at the revolver code and GOOD FUCKING LORD WHAT WAS WHO SMOKING WHEN THEY MADE THAT. The only defense against a pistolwhip stunning/KOing you for 60 ticks of your life() proc is wearing a hat with a bitflag that hats no longer even have. And that's even IF the code that handles applying the damage decides that your armor protected you from the hit. Keep in mind that shit like oxytanks or toolboxes only stun for about 5 ticks of life() and that's only if the code passes a percentile check based on the amount of damage the attacked body part has taken. In conclusion, fuck that shit. Also, shooting people point-blank now plays the gunshot sound. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1230 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 New map is pointless without the .dme that includes it, derp derp. Headset+Earphones=Earset. Because headphones is too long. Sprite request fulfilled. Increased limits on cyborgs at round start.

And their sprite sucks dwarven cock. So here's another one which I've made a while ago but, as always, was too commited to otherstuff to actually upload.

 Fixed up Deeaych's round-start cyborgs, they no longer spawn on the title screen As a side effect of fixing this, since digging into the related code to make it not the case would be a chore and a half, round-start cyborgs are capable of being traitors, receiving the same objective/law set as an AI would. Much like a traitor AI, they can use a robotics terminal to hack themselves to unlock the emag module, at the cost of RED ANTENNA ROUGE BORG. It has been suggested that they get additional perks, such as immunity to robotics terminal detonation/lockdown, but I am wary of adding such things right off the bat. We shall see. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1204 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Robotic Transformation's cure simplified so that maybe it'll work now. Cyborgs are a job available at round start. They have randomized cyborg names and half capacity batteries so that they aren't as good as made cyborgs right off the bat. Two slots. They are intended to start in AI Foyer: for whatever reason, THIS IS NOT WORKING. The cyborgs start on the title screen. I don't know how to fix it and I've given up on trying so that I don't make it worse. Someone more brilliant handle it please! Green labcoat and green glasses are on the map in the theater. Medbay front desk flip-turned upside down. Anyone who approaches should see and be seen by whomever's manning it sooner. With that, the new sign, and the downplayed doctor entrance, I'm hoping the exam room will be emphasized more and it will actually see some use. Exam room has shutters. The button is all access so you can't be trapped in there save the usual ways of power failure and the like. The door facing the hall is all access as well, which, again, should encourage people to use the room. The door to medbay requires doctor access and has no shutter under it so that doctors can watch doctors watching patients. Watching the watchmen sort of thing. Added a special kind of dropper for the service borg to use so he's not mixing the tiniest drinks ever. It holds and pumps with the size of a normal pour that a human hand could do into a bottle. Added a special kind of roburger with plenty of bites for use as a traitor unlock for an emagged service cyborg. The e-sword was too robust. Roburger should work out better because of its delay, its chance for failure, and it's now higher possibility of cure. It's also a nice novelty ability and thematically linked to the service cyborg itself. Changelog updated with most recent player-important changes. If I missed something that should have been included, then I am a buttface and please tell me so. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1203 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Welding mask change reverted. Green lab coat can now be spawned. Tweak to several sprites, nothing major. Default sprite added to masks, so that some gimmick items may be spawned now. Tea has a funnier name and description. Vending machine changed to "Hot" from "Warm" to better reflect contents. Service Cyborgs can be picked! Shaker, dropper, tray, pen+paper for note/order taking and DOSH to show their class off. When emagged, Colonel Butlertron did it in Atmosia with the Energy Sword. Possibly bugged, must investigate further. (SoS authorized some live testing!) git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1197 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Forum authentication now modifies a user's default group. phpBB doesn't sanity check the group_id field in phpbb_users, and so even though users no longer belonged to their old default group, phpBB still assumed they did and used those permissions. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1195 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 This is a rather big mecha update (not everything is polished, bughunt in progress). - Mechs equipment is customizable (you can add different equipment to mechs). Weapons go to combat mechs only, clown mech equipment - to HONK only. Clamp goes only to Ripley. - Mech equipment can be built by mech fabricator. - Added mecha RCD, mecha teleporter, mecha wormhole generator equipment. - Equipment(if any left) can be pried from mecha wreckage with crowbar. - Mech control console circuitboard added to circuit storage. - Mechs can teleport from teleport hub. - Fixed ripley cargo problems with moving objects(bots, carps, huggers etc). Loading hostile organisms may be harmful. Be vigilant. - Fixed bug with many mobs climbing inside one mecha. - Fixed mecha "unable-to-move" message spam.

 Air alarms improved. New functions are: - mass control all air machines in area (5 modes) - adjustable alarm thresholds - air alarm in server room now is preset to treat temperature 80 K as okay. EMP now affects bots internal cameras. Fixed problem with AI clicking on mulebot. Some fixes for welding with unlit welder, mostly cosmetic. Airlock controller (as in EVA) now react to commands faster. Access controller (was in engineering and virology in past) was speeded up too. One is installed into Incinerator to demonstrate that now it isn't fucking slow. Airlock in toxin mixing room now have pump, so airlock can work properly. Added some intercoms to medbay lobby.

 Waistcoats should have a working suit storage now, allowing PDAs and pens Cryo no longer makes people inside the tube only process reagents every 10th tick (which was fucking retarded, considering that the cryoxadone happens to BE a reagent) Clonexadone now heals non-cloneloss at the same rate as regular cryo reagent, so it's not strictly better in all cases. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1179 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Made a change to the cloner, since I was getting reports of people abusing quirks in the damage system to pop clones out way early without having to muck about with things like cryo. Mobs now have a "cloneloss" var, used to represent the fact that they aren't done being cloned. There are exactly 2 ways to heal cloneloss outside of badminnery. 1) Don't get popped out of the tube early. 2) Load a cryo tube with Clonexadone (mix Cyroxadone, Plasma, and Sodium to make) and hop in. Clonexadone also happens to heal regular damages twice as fast as cryoxadone, so it has more use than just fixing quickclones. PDA medscanners aren't sophisticated enough to detect cloning imperfections, but the ones found in medkits are. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1178 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Yet another wonderful design from R&D! Dubbed the "Bag of Holding", this latest wonder is a backpack that has had the interior filled with a Bluespace generator. This allows for unmatched item storage potential! The generator has proven perfectly reliable under light use, but heavy loads have been proven to cause strain, eventually leading to total failure and loss of any stored items. Additionally, the generator does NOT play nice with other applications of Bluespace, do not wear or carry the device while attempting to teleport, or attempt to place one into the Bluespace pocket of a second device. The Bluespace interface has been observed to destabilize gravitational singularities. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1176 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Bomberman Update - Added a new trait to cameras: Hardened. Hardened is a modifier to the chance a camera will be affected by an EMP. By default, all cameras are affected 100% of the time by a full strength EMP. Will add some hardening to existing cameras once some pending map changes get finished. - New R&D Invention: LARGE GRENADES. You can now put basically any container (except blender jugs) into it and they affect a larger area. Want a 100 x 100 unit grenade? You now can! The basic casings are made in a protolathe (Materials 3, Combat 3). Unless you've developed them a lot, you'll occasionally get duds (which just spits out the beakers). Duds can be deconstructed in the DA to improve reliability. - On a related note, an unintended side effect of making large beakers hold more has been fixed. - Constructible frames, after the circuit board has been inserted, can be right-click/examined to reveal what parts it needs to be finished. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1146 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Chinese Sweatshop Update: - Fixed some machine-board design issues. Mainly that they make the machine rather then the board :x - Autolathe, Protolathe and Circuit Imprinter now dump out any materials you stored in it if you dismantle them. Reagents get dumped into any beakers that were required to make the damn thing in the first place. - AI upload computer can now be deconstructed. However, it can't be deconstructed unless you right click and select "accessinternals." Otherwise, it disassembles like a normal computer. - Circuit Imprinter now accepts gold and diamond sheets. Bling bling. - AI modules now require gold and/or diamond to be constructed. - Server Room rearrange. Also, server room has a "lobby" area where you can go without freezing/suffocating. - New "R&D Server" and "Server Control" control computer added to the server room. Instead of uploading to eachother, R&D consoles now upload to all servers they have access rights to and download from all servers they have download rights from. New R&D consoles have no upload or download rights but any that start on the map at round start do. The new console allows for the changing of server access and manipulation of server data. Servers can also be hacked. This can result in either the device being disabled (can't upload/download data), hacked (any console can download data from it), or electrified (derp, ow). The Server Control console also can delete data from servers. - R&D Console's "Connect/Disconnect" from network setting determines whether it shows up on the Server Control's menu when looking at what devices it can give/take server access from. Note: The server room and the server control needs RD access. If you don't have that, that's what emags are for :3 - ADMIN NOTE: There is also a master Server and Server Control on centcom. Whenever data is sync'ed to the network, it automatically uploads (but not downloads) data from the centcom server. This is so that if a griffan destroys the servers on the station, you can restore the lost progress. Only the centcom Server control can transfer data between servers. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1140 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Experimental new master_controller settings. They appear to not cause massive clusterfuckery on my test server, but the changes will likely behave differently on the live server.

 Added a thing so it's easier to track if the master controller has assed up. Admins now have an extra bit in their status tab that monitors the master controller. Under normal circumstances, it should say "no" during pre-round, switch to "yes" for the first few seconds of the actual round, then switch to "no" while occasionally blinking to "yes". If it stops blinking to "yes", the master controller has broken and you need to press the button. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1130 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Mech Fabricator now accepts materials that aren't metal or glass. BS'd some values for what you get per-unit on nonstandard ores, since the standard "one sheet = 3750" that glass and metal use seems a bit excessive for things like diamonds.

 MAPPING: - slight change to arrival hallway ADMIN COMMANDS: - Added 3 commands to 'secrets': Move mining shuttle, move administration shuttle and move ferry. Each of these moves their respective shuttle. This is only intended for admin events. The mining shuttle still takes the 15-ish seconds to arrive, the other two are instantanious. All generate admin logs and admin-log-spam to prevent abuse. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1124 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Duckberg Update: - Uranium coins can now be produced from the mint. You can also produce more then 10 coins at a time. - Two new more advanced versions of the PACMAN type portable generator: SUPERPACMAN (runs off of uranium coins, produces ~10,000 power base; requires Materials 5 and power tech 4) and MRSPACMAN (runs off of diamond coins, produces ~20,000 power base; requires materials 6 and power tech 5). Construction nearly identical to the basic PACMAN generator. - Fixed some R&D bugs. Always forgetting something. Copy/paste is the devil. - Tweaked nuclear gun slightly. I need to make a better R&D readme one of these days... - Tier 3 stock parts added. These often require rare mateirals (such as from mining) and aren't 100% reliable. However, they do allow some machines to become quite powerful... Note: Since I forgot it in the last update: To use the generators, you have to wrench them into place over a wire connected to the powergrid you want to pump power into. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1116 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Wakka Wakka update - PACMAN-type portable power generator now producable through the R&D system. You insert solid plasma coins (minted from solid plasma which you get from miners) into the generator and when you turn it on, it produces power (~5000 for a baseline model). Useful for powering small powernets/rooms. More powerful generators will be added eventually. To unlock the design, you need Plasma Technology 2 and Power Storage 3. To construct, it's 5 metal (Machine Frame) => cable => PACMAN board => 1 matter bin, 1 micro laser, 2 pieces of cable, and a capacitor => Screwdriver to finish. Screwdriver => Crowbar to start the deconstruction process. If not 100% reliable, the device will break down eventually. - R&D console disk commands now actually work. Derp. - In the R&D console settings menu, you can reset the console's R&D database to the default data. Make sure to backup data onto disk if you don't want to lose it! - Instruction manuals in mech_construction.dm and mining.dm moved to code\game\objects\items\weapons\manuals.dm to make them easier to find. Condensed down some of the redundant code. - R&Dinstruction manual added to the R&D lab. - Fixed a pair of Destructive Analyzer bugs. If an object contains a mob (such as an intellicard with an AI in it), it runs the death routine for that mob. - Protolathe now accepts uranium. GO FORTH, COMRADES. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1114 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Added an exciting new item for R&D to research! Advanced Energy Gun Tired of having to run back to a recharge station because your guns run out of charge? No more! Using advanced miniaturization techniques, we have managed to shove a fully functional nuclear reactor into the grip of an otherwise standard energy gun. Space requirements resulted in the removal of the standard recharger port you don't need because of the awesome reactor we added! (Note: reactor not entirely stable. Minor radiation leaks have been reported, along with occasional reactor failure.) git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1113 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Blood: The Last Annoying, Sparkly Twit Update: - When a blood sample is taken, it retains some information on what kind of chemicals were the subject's body at the time the sample was taken. - Two new R&D Items: Mass-Spectrometer (EM Spectrum Research 2, Biotech 2) and Advanced Mass-Spectrometer (EM Spectrum Research 4, Biotech 2). Allows for the identification of chemicals in a blood sample. To use the devices, you simply use a container (or syringe) full of blood on the device and then click the device in your hand (like how you use the gas analyzer). At low reliability, they might miss some chemicals in their report or potentially even break. The Advanced version not only lists what chemicals were present in the body, but also much much. - The deconstructive analyzer now gives 1 or 2 points to a device design's reliability (rather then just 1) when analyzing a device. Also fixed some bugs in the deconstructive analyzer. - Not all devices have a 100% reliability now (most current ones did, but not all). - Few tweaks in R&D lab. Derp derp. - Mint tweaked slightly. Miners can now access the mint foyer and the mint materials loading area but not the vault (only the captain can access the vault, by default). - Research sub-paths Robotics and generators removed. Now all techs just use the primary paths. Sub-paths might be re-added later but not these ones. - Power Storage Technology renamed "Power Manipulation Technology". - More stuff can be analyzed in the destructive analyzer. Intellicards can now be produced from the protolathe (Programming 4. Requires 1000 glass and 200 gold) - Updated the R&D readme file. Now it has a list of all the holes in the tech paths (ie. Where we need to add new stuff). It's not intended as a complete list of everything that can be made or researched, just a check list to make sure all the research levels are covered. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1073 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Miners have their own uniforms. Someone else is going to have to put them on the map in the mining colony, I'm not touching any of that. Here's hoping I didn't break something when I made them spawn with the new uniforms. Also, the pickaxe and shovel are now the same size as every other tool.

Deconstructing a machine made in this way, the order is screwdriver (to open panel) > crowbar (to pop parts out) > wire cutters > Wrench - Autolathe, Protolathe, Circuit Imprinter, and Destructive analyzer all are affected by what parts you make them with, can be built, and can be deconstructed now. - Origin Tech var changed from a list to a string to save memory/processing. It's not a problem right now, but it could be one in the future. - Item paths for stock parts changed around a bit to make typing easier. - A lot of items have been given an origin_tech var and as such, a lot more things can be analyzed to further SCIENCE! Try and find them :D - R&D Lab added to that semi-empty area in the north part of toxins. R&D Console, Destructive Analyzer, Protolathe, and Circuit Imprinter added along with all the other tools and (basic) materials required. Very little "new" stuff is available but you can still unlock existing tech (such as AI modules or circuit boards) so that you can make more copies of them. - Changelog updated. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1059 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Robuddy is now a Honkbuddy. Honkbuddy has a hacked sprite in which it laughs, a passive on state, and an active (honking) on state. The off state is mostly identical to how it was previously. It was an unused sprite anyway. Robotics headset added. It's black base to fit with their uniform, has a yellow engineering sprite to identify them as under that head, and medical's blue light as a nod to where they came from. Diamond sprite is less contrasting and semi-transparent. Cook book coffee stain hopefully looks more like a coffee stain. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1026 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 RADIO HEADSET update by Barhandar and me: Three new channels and new :h-like shortcuts for each channel. shortcuts now are: ":r" = "right hand" (unchanged) ":l" = "left hand" (unchanged) ":i" = "intercom" (unchanged) ":h" = "department" (unchanged for everyone except captain) ":w" = "whisper" (NEW shortcut) ":b" = "binary" (CHANGED) ":a" = "alientalk" (unchanged) ":t" = "Syndicate" (NEW channel) ":c" = "Command" (NEW shortcut) ":n" = "Science" (NEW channel) ("n" because all other letters are occupied) ":m" = "Medical" (NEW shortcut) ":e" = "Engineering" (NEW shortcut) ":s" = "Security" (NEW shortcut) Note: ":h" works as before, i.e. sends on engineering channel for engineers and CE, on medical channel for MD, CMO,etc and so on. All heads have command channel in their headsets along with department channel. Warden and QM aren't heads. Captain have almost all channels in his/her headset, but some are switched off by default. The default channel for captain is "Command" now. Bugs fixed: If headset is tuned to other frequency dept channel don't work. A receive wire in intercoms can be cut. Some others bugs. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1020 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 One click queue system added, which affects gameplay completely. Previously: After clicking on one thing, you could not click on another thing before 1 second had passed, and had to spam until 1 second had passed. Now: After one click, if there's a second click right after, it will be queued and executed automatically after the 1 second has passed. Tried to remove redundant DblClick() entries and changed them to QueueClick() where appropriate. Report for bugs. Updated change log. :-) git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1019 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Y2K update: - New "empulse" proc. Works similarly to "explode" proc. It triggers the "emp_act" proc on everything within range. emp_act are effects similar or identical to the effects of the emp grenade. Any major changes to emp effects listed below. Note: EMPs now affect items in your backpack. - New admin right-click command: EM Pulse. You can create an empulse at the desired location with a size you choose. Similar to Explosion command. - disable device spell, emp grenade, and disable tech rune all use empulse now. - New "disable device" spell datum added. - EMP'ed gas canisters no longer drain the station of power. - When a borg is EMP'ed, all objects in their module get their emp_act proc triggered. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1018 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Ghetto surgery added. If you have some tools, you can table someone and operate on them! Of course, since it's a regular table instead of a proper operating table, it's pretty easy to mess up and accidentally stab them in the face instead, but odds are if you're not in the surgery room, you don't care. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@1008 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 "By Our Powers Combined" Update: - R&D Console interface re-done a bit. Unlinked machines don't show up at all on the main menu but you can see what machines are linked and what aren't in the settings menu. - Object path for robo-crate power cell changed. - Basic and "super" power cells can now be deconstructed (in a deconstructive analyzer) for tech. - New power cell: "SUPER" power cells. Can be built through R&D research (Req. Power Storage Tech 5) and holds twice as much as the power cell you get from robotics crates. Unfortunately, like a lot of prototype technology, it is unreliable. They'll randomly not recharge and eventually will stop recharging at all. - Items with reliability < 90 and haven't critically failed cannot be destroyed in a destructive analyzer. - Imprinter and Protolathe now drop their results on themselves rather then a linked destructive analyzer. Derp. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@998 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

If anyone else has any more mapping changes or updates to make, please do them ACCESS: - Scientists granted medbay access (temporarely, so they can get out) - I REPEAT: TEMPORARELY!!! MAPPERS NOTE: - If you wish to add more than one access requirement for doors or machinery, edit the req_access_txt like so: "5;6" if it requires accesses 5 AND 6.

 Bombs, Lasers, and Magnets, Oh my! Update: - Destructive Analyzer now only sends HALF of the material it salvages to a linked protolathe rather then all of it (some gets lost in the process). - Lowered tech requirements of basic parts. - Circuit Imprinter and Destructive Analyzer now properly use power. - Added rating 2 versions of the basic stock parts (and the designs so you can make them). Note: Stock parts all have a rating that can affect the end result if you want them to (example: A lathe made with a rating 2 matter bin can hold more material then a rating 1 bin). Granted, I haven't added any handling for this yet, but it's there if needed :3 - Add some lights to various areas and redid break area some more.

 Fixed some of the stuff that was wrong on the updated map. I think it should be playable now. MAP CHANGES: - Some slight area changes all around the station (some tiles weren't in their right areas) - Reverted previously reverted changes to mining dock and engineering (they were reverted by accident) - MDs and CMO will now spawn on the map, rather than on the welcome screen - Added a window to the medbay-maintenance intersection from genetics + 2 beds in the room, so people can leave bodies there for genetics. - Some aesthetic changes to the production line... the single windows looked pretty bad... - Some other minor changes which i don't completely remember OLD MAP (before the medbay changes) is saved in maps/tgstation 2.0.0.dmm NEW MAP (with medbay changes) is now saved in maps/tgstation 2.0.1.dmm git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@981 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Cat ears with wiggling tail added to hats. Need more information on movement states before it can be refined further. Sprited with the intention of furry cat bits taking the color of the player's hair -- pink inner ear bits overlayed on top. Also, telekinesis aura pulses ala thermal insulation. Even the fat sprite. Horsehead mask has had its outline softened. Black lips retained. I don't see any changes in storage.dmi but it says I did SOMETHING, so there it is to prevent future conflicts.

 Mostly a behind-the-scenes change, stuffing someone's brain into a cyborg body now causes the mind datum to transfer over to the new body. This should prevent such shenanigans as cloning a borged guy to suck the player back to the fleshy side of life. Given that the mind datum is where traitors store their objectives (and how assassination targets are tracked), I have gone to some effort to ensure that, much like people currently in the thunderdome, people that are borgs still get counted as being dead. Also, borgs cannot succeed at hijack/escape objectives. If you find this to not be the case, PLEASE REPORT IT. Borging a changeling now ends the round, much like cremating/gibbing them does. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@962 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 More R&D Stuff: - Destructive analyzer has a new, spiffier icon by Veyveyr! Old icon's moved to old_and_unused.dmi. Since stationobjs.dmi was getting crowded, a lot of completely unused icons were moved as well. - R&D console now will link to any Destructive Analyzer, Protolathe, or Circuit Imprinter up to 3 tiles away (but two machines won't link to the same console or vice versa). Also, it will only link up to one of each. - New stock parts: Micro-laser and Matter Bin - Computer Frame icons moved to stock_parts.dmi - New build frame: "Machine Frame." Similar to a computer frame, you can make a variety of generically boxy machines with it. It'll cost five metal to build (as well as all the other parts) but it won't be accessible to players just yet (there really wouldn't be a whole lot for them to build). More will be add eventually as part of the R&D system. - Circuit boards are now divided into types. "computer" boards are used in a computer frame to make a computer console, "machine" boards are used in a Machine frame to make a machine of some type. Other types may or may not be added in the future. Mecha boards will be redone to this format eventually. - New Circuit Boards (Machine Type): Protolathe, Destructive Analyzer, Circuit Imprinter, and Autolathe. - New Traitor Item! Paralysis Pen. It looks like a penlight (the kind all doctors start with) except it injects Zombie Powder into the victim (similar to a changeling's paralysis dart). The target is aware but cannot move, speak, or emote. They also appear to be dead on health analyzers. Non-refillable and costs two telecrystals. - Anti-toxin now works on Zombie Powder. It was intended to work, I just forgot to add it. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@961 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

Also, while it's being overhauled as part of the R&D update, it'll be removed from the rest of the station. Don't worry, it'll come back! Also, all the disk closets were removed as well. - Circuit Imprinter now works like the protolathe: It needs to be connected to an R&D console and it get's it's production list from it. - Replaced destructive analyzer icon (thanks Deuryn). - New item type: Stock Parts.

 We Can Rebuild It! update: - Added destructive analyzer machine. You can stick items in it and deconstruct them to boost your tech levels. To function properly, it has to be built to the right/east of a R&D Console. It's controls are accessed from the linked R&D console. - Protolathe added. It's an autolathe linked to an R&D console (it has to be built to the left/west of the R&D console). It can build any design stored in it's linked R&D console. Just feed glass/metal into the lathe like normal. Also, items destroyed in the Destructive Analyzer feed their raw materials into the Protolathe. - R&D Console can upload it's data to all other R&D consoles in the game. Granted, that means someone might gain access to data you don't want them to but it also means that if your R&D console is destroyed, you won't lose all your data. Of course, you could always just back the data up on to disks. - All objects now have a origin_tech and reliability var. origin_tech is a list of technologies that were used to create the object (in theory, anyway). It's used by the destructive analyzer to figure out what you learn from dismantling it. Reliability doesn't do anything on its own but it will (Eventually) be used by some constructed devices/machines to determine how reliable they are. Objects have a origin_tech var of null by default and can't be put in the destructive analyzer at all. - Protolathe, R&D Console, and Destructive Analyzer added to Centcom for admins to play with (doesn't do a whole lot, at the moment). git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@935 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 MAP UPDATES: - Moved the Chief Engineer into his new office. Developers now have enough room to add new toys for him or the other engineers. - Replaced the old CE's office with an observing area and lunge. This can be changed to anything you'd like - Added two manuals to engineering: "Station repairs and construction" and "Hacking". My reasoning is that since both are freely available on the wiki, no point in not having them ingame as-well. - Addd a welding fuel tank near the disposal unit, since that area had no fuel tank at all - Fixed some area mismatch at the mining storage area - Replaced the MK2 medical computer in the operating theater to a MK1 medical computer (same version as all the other medical computers on the map). - Moved the engineering request console a bit so it doesn't cover the doors (i'll get to removing those stupid doors eventually) git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@931 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 SCIENCE! Update: - More R&D stuff. Moved code from code/datums/technology to code/game/research (more apt and it isn't JUST datums now). Still very WIP. - Circuit printer now requires Sulfuric Acid instead of H2SO4. (Yes, I get the irony) - New helper proc: between(low, middle, high). It returns middle unless it is greater than high (in which case, it returns high) or less than low (in which case it returns low). It's a fairly simple proc but it cleans up some bits of code I am working on. - Changeling chem regeneration is now a curve rather then a flat amount. At low amounts (<20) it's faster then in r917, at high amounts it's slower (>20). This means you can use cheap abilities more often and expensive abilities less. - Changeling "Dart" abilities now named "sting" abilities to (Hopefully) cause less confusion.

 Added eye surgery as a start to the surgical procedures. Performed by targeting eyes while patient is on an operating table. Steps are scalpel > retractor > hemostat > cautery. These steps will change in the future, when surgery becomes a little more complicated. Really this is just an excuse for me to make the operating room which will follow this update shortly. Included sterilizine, which is going to be part of future surgical updates. Also fixed that thing where all the tools were named the same.

 Map fixes. Lots and lots of map fixes. Reduced the number of powernets by 30. Most due to corrected errors when copy-pasting map tiles and copy-pasting pieces of wire with them, some due to just minimization of powernets by joining up nets that were previously purposely left disconnected.

 Mining: - The return of random mineral spawning - Basic code for random mine generation: not yet implemented on the map - removed the fluorescent lights at the entrance and replaced them with a light emitter (invisible object) to simulate the effect of transitioning into a dark mine. (need someone to test if right-clicking the plot gets the light emitter object in the context menu) Map changes: - Replaced some floor tiles with airless tiles on the abandoned, russian station. - Slight changes to engineering intended to make room for expansion - This was in the last update, but didn't point it out specifically: opened a new construction site just below the mining dock. I intend to build it up through the course of several updates into the mining processing and storage areas as the dock currently does not have enough space in it. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@858 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 The Not-As-Big-As-It-Seems Update: Changelings Overhauled. - Instead of working on a cooldown system like wizards, changlings now have a "Chemical Storage" that fills up over time (similar to alium plasma). Different abilities use different amounts of chemicals. Changlings start with 20 chem. - Neurotoxic Venom and Hallucinogenic Venom both removed entirely. - Regenerative Stasis now shows the person as being dead. - Absorb DNA costs 5 chem, Transform costs 5 chem, Lesser (monkey) transform costs 1, and Regenerative Stasis costs 20. - Five new "Dart" abilities. They each have a quick cooldown (to prevent spamming on accident), cost different amounts of chemicals, and hit adjecent enemies (targeting similar to old venoms). - Silence Dart (10 chem): Makes the target unable to speak for a while. Target knows when they are hit. - Blind Dart (20 chem): Makes the target blind for a while. Target knows when they're hit (even ignoring the obvious blindness). - Deaf Dart (5 chem): Makes the target deaf for a while. Target does NOT instantly know they were hit (not hearing their own speach might be a clue, though). - Paralysis Dart (30 chem): Paralyzes the target for a bit. They can't speak or move and health scanners register them as being dead. However, they are fully aware of their surroundings. It's also obvious to them they were pricked. - Transformation Dart (30 chem): Transforms a dead, non-husk person into one of your stored DNA types. (NOTE) A lot of playtesting needed to balance the above, just FYI. Most likely, chem costs will need to be adjusted (both up and down). - Changelog Updated. - Napalm Nerfed/Adjusted: Instead of creating (Created_Volume * 2) * 9 squares, it creates (Created Volume^2) * 1 square. This works out to about a 30% reduction for a max volume grenade. Also, it won't accidentally freeze areas now (if activated in an area with no oxygen). - Reagent bottles can, once again, be added to grenades instead of just beakers. You can't add other (potentially larger) containers, though. - Carp are now poisonous to eat. Anti-toxin must be injected into any carp-based food item before eating to eat it safely. - New Reagent: Zombie Powder: Requires 5 carpotoxin, 5 copper, and 5 sleep toxin. Puts subject into a deathlike state (they're still aware though). - New Recipes: Clown Burger, 5 Flour + 1 CLown Wig/mask; Mime Burger, 5 Flour + 1 Beret; Cuban Carp, 1 carp fillet + 1 flour + 1 chili. - New Circuit Imprinter Icon by Veyveyr. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@854 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Mining updates: - Minerals can now spawn randomly. If you don't want tiles to spawn minerals use the /turf/simulated/mineral turf type, otherwise use /turf/simulated/mineral/random for them to generate random minerals. - Randomly generated minerals spread in seams - Known issues include the updating of wall tiles and spawning of floors and... well quite a bit of stuff with random mineral plots. For the moment they're mainly aesthetic. Working on fixing the rest of the stuff. Map updates: - Added random mineral patches to the mining level. They are generally a few plots behind the wall that you see, so random minerals will not be visible from the mines themselves. (for the moment anyway) - Updated the construction site - mining dock git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@833 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Yayificaiton Update: - Added some comments to circuit imprinter. - Sleepypen nerfed from 50 units to 30 units. Still FAR more then you really need but still keeps them down for quite a while.

 Some revisions for removing wizard spells, along with minor mind.dm revisions. Wizards can no-longer cast when dead. Fixed issues with Transfer Mind spell. Wizards now begin with a random name (but can choose a different one). Wizards may now re-use their spell book to memorize a new set of spells (can only be done on the wizard shuttle). Added special role for cultists, revs, and nuke operatives for that round type. Respawn Character special admin verb should now give the target the same mind if they were gibbed/had a mind as a ghost. This means traitors, changelings, etc, would retain their traitor status but not their powers/equipment. General updates to that proc. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@819 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Singularity now wont leave floor under eaten walls. Cryo wont spit out beaker. Fixed message "You don't have the dexterity to do this" for machinery. PIPES: - Heat exchange pipes are constructable now. - Insulated pipes also were added to pipe dispenser; - And meters too; - Easy pipe rotating in hands; - bent pipes actually looks bent under construction (may be glitches, please report); - pipes now wont cover wires; - pipes unwrenching now possible; - large vent pumps now uses power as equipment, not environment - pumps now uses power; Air alarm improvements: - all alarms in area controls all environment machines in area; - machines initializes itself automatically and without interloping with existing ones; - air alarms wont duplicates it air monitoring and can clear itself; Some other typos and small issues were fixed. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@816 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Reverted previous changes to fire closets and emergency closets. The spawn percentages seemed weird. In addition it didn't make much sense to have fire closets spawning at random in the hallways. Stations obviously wouldn't have fire closets just sitting in the hallways, they'd be tucked away in maintenance areas to be used when needed. I've added fire closets to various key areas on the station in maintenance areas, atmos, etc. to ensure that fire equipment is readily accesible. Additionally, due to the specific-placement I've undone the random spawn potential for items in fire closets, which again didnt' make much sense. They will all now spawn with the appropriate equipment. Discussed this a bit in IRC before going through with this. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@815 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Of What Things May Come Update: - A few last re-adds of Pierrot's throat stuff /sigh - Circuit Imprinter Added. It makes new circuit boards, AI Modules, and stuff. Insert a disk with the circuit design into the machine, load in glass and sulfuric acid (placeholder for now) and go nuts. Circuit Design disks are stored in their related departments. - To accommodate the new lockers, the RD's office is slightly bigger. - Chief Medical Officer can no longer be mistakenly picked for the Rev/Cult intercept reports. Warden can no longer be mistakenly picked for Revolution intercept reports. - New AI Module: T.Y.R.A.N.T., Think evil PALADIN module, or perhaps XISC without those pesky asimov laws. Need sleeps so if anything is broken, sorry. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@811 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Added descriptions to wizard spells. Beefed up Mind Transfer. Can now swap with traitors/revs/etc. Limited to humans and monkeys, and may not transfer to changelings, wizards, or cultists. Targets must still have a mind and a client for this to work (must also be alive). Mind Transfer now correctly works for mime targets or other targets with special verbs. Added a proper spell book for wizards. Changelings are now properly assigned their special role at round start. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@810 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Wizards no longer start out as members of the crew. Their basic equipment is also reduced to the bare neccessities. Wizard spells will be selectable through a time, instead of PDA/other. Currently inserted as the radio uplink. Spells are now contained within a single file. Added new spell, mind transfer. Allows the user to swap bodies with any available (non-braindead) human being. Traitors, changelings, and other similar people are not affected. It is possible to lose spells during the transfer. 1 minute cooldown. Probably still has bugs and/or balance issues. Wizard teleport cooldown increased to 60 seconds. All humanoid aliens (other than queen) may now vent crawl. Hunters gain shorter devour time and a new ability to regurgitate their victims (if they are still alive). git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@807 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Moved barrier icons to objects.dm. Updated barrier graphics. Barriers now spawn in the Armory (and four in the vacant Sec office), until they are tested. Required access was changed to Security likewise. Fixed firesuit down graphics, along with hazard vest. Reduced the number of fireclosets spawning instead of oxygen closets. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@804 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 added fire closets to spawn around the station. Each emergency closet has a 1/3 chance of changing to a fire closet. Lots of updates to mining, added satchels which can carry 10 pieces of ore each, they can gather all the ore from a tile at once or one at a time. They can get loaded into ore boxes, which can carry an unlimited amount, currently. Rail cars move much faster now, but demand more processor time, they will eventually get the role of getting loaded from satchels and producing ore boxes. Simply to make it easy to carry around hundreds of pieces of ore. (resubmit) git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@799 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Just some minor changes. I re-added the fire closets, and also changed them up quite a bit. They now output the exact same equipment that was previously on a rack in atmospherics. Said racks have been replaced with fire closets, maybe it'll give a hint to atmos that they're yanno... supposed to put out fires. Also changed Head of Staff's office to Head of Personnel, and Head of Research's office to Research Director's. Figured it would be useful to update them. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@798 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Removed the new shuttle-dock hallway. Repositioned the shuttle dock, various other fixes/adjustments related to this. Placed Mech Bay and chargers on the map. Re-added PALADIN AI module to AI Upload. Moved a chair on the Bridge so it's positioned properly. Added mech chargers to CentCom. Removed deployable barriers from engineering (or rather, overwrote them). Moved DJ station location. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@797 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 A new look for the fire suit. Edited the lefthand, righthand, suit and suits files. defined under clothing/suit/fire/firefighter and has the same properties as the fire suit apart from icon_state and item_state.

 Still more hair tweaking. Long hair made more subtle. Highlights less contrasting, except on bedhead and dreadlock, which imo work. All hairs should have highlights now, barring facial hair. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@787 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Phase 2 of PDA overhaul Moved cartridge-only PDA menu code to the cartridges themselves, so the PDA code is less of a single massive clusterfuck. It should be functionally identical ingame, but if we want to add new PDA cart features, it will be less of a hassle now. In theory. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@786 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Phase 1 of PDA overhaul Moved radio-based PDA functions to a separate object embedded into the PDA carts, like how traitor PDAs have an embedded uplink Phase 2 will consist of chopping out the related menu function bits from the mass of PDA code and having them be separate, again as with the PDA uplinks One bugfix related to Phase 1 is that PDAs with a QM/Sec cart in them will no longer constantly pull focus away from the main window if you leave your PDA window open. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@784 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Right. This includes both some updates from myself, as well as some updates to mining from errorage. My updates: -Alert Computer ( as seen in CE's office and bridge) renamed to Station Alert Computer. Object path altered to reflect this change (formerly computer/atmospherics/alerts, now computer/station_alert) -Circuit board changed to reflect above alteration. Renamed as well (also easier to figure out what it goes to with the new name) -Alert Computer added to atmospherics. -Alert computer will now report on power failures on the station. -Alert computer will now flash red (similar to atmos alert computer) when an alert is present. -General Alert computer renamed to Atmospheric Alert Computer. Same as changes to alert computer, however there was no circuit board to fix. -Fixed bug in which APCs were not properly clearing power alerts for the AI and alert computers. -Fixed a bug in which atmos alert computers were not properly updating icon_state-wise on a power change (they would just vanish). This bug also affected the updated station alert computer, but as I said this has been resolved. I think that's it on my updates. Errorage's updates are to the mining station and construction area. He vanished on IRC so I can't get him to cough up more details and I need sleep, so he can comment on this if he wants. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@772 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Divided aliens into castes: drones, hunters, and sentinels. Modified their sprites and abilities to reflect this. Aliens now have a mind variable when not admin-spawned. Spawning generic alien humanoids is still possible but not recommended. Alien procs changed to reflect alien castes. Updated respawn character proc. Should now work right and factor in jobs if specified. Added Neo's PALADIN core module to AI upload. Pulse rifles are not spawnable by admins below coder rank. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@770 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Alien fixes/changes: Alien stun chance on harm decreased. Alien stab intent changed to stun intent which deals light damage. It does have a very high chance of knock down and an even higher chance of disarming the target. Hud icon changed to reflect this. Upped the chance aliens stunning cyborgs with stun intent. Updated aliens attacking monkeys code. Aliens can now directly attack the AI. General code cleanup for alien attacks and others attacking aliens (hand to hand). Humanoid aliens may no longer run on tables. Fixed a typo in the Corrode ability. Increased the amount of abuse resin walls can take. Changed how damaging them works (as windows). Hulks may now smash straight through resin walls. Aliens may now destroy them without acid (and can no longer use acid on them). Spit now produces a message when used. Fixed aliens not being stunned by stun batons. Aliens can now attack/destroy turrets. Removed alien vision loss from being shot by lasors. Aliens are not deterred by flash now (flashbangs should still work). You can no-longer stab aliens in their nonexistent eyes with screwdrivers or forks. Changing a mob into an alien now properly sets their intent (help).

 RL in IRC Update: - The soymilk + enzyme reaction to create tofu will now make multiple pieces of tofu depending on how much you are mixing together instead of just 1 no matter how much you mix together. - Deleted some garbage code that I'm no longer going to implement (at least not any time soon). - Candy Corn nutriment value reduced to something sensible rather then AUTO FAT - By popular admin request, Guest accounts are not allowed to be any head of staff, the AI, or any security position. Unfortunately, that means if your BYOND name begins with "Guest-", you can't be those positions either. However, that's your own problem. I'll enable the config.txt setup for it later. - Napalm actually works now. It's Aluminum + Plasma + Sulfuric Acid. It creates a relatively short but intense fire over an area and will spread like a normal toxin's fire. - Incendiary grenades redone into a normal chem grenade that makes napalm. Old style incendiary grenade code removed since it didn't work anyway. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@750 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Bridge changes. Eliminated the command centre in the middle of the bridge, it was bulky and despite being useful didn't really do much in the way of good for the bridge.

Conn / Operations - Communications, cameras, and station alerts. Medical - Crew monitoring and medical records.

 Alium changes: Aliens are now scary. Be careful of all those friendly xenos running about. Scythe-like arms can now seriously injure you if they get an opportunity. Spit now costs 50 plasma instead of 25. It works like a taser (no more homing spit). The effect is the same as the old spit but instead of fire loss, it deals toxin damage. Riot shields can still block spit 50% of the time. Spit overloads (stuns) a cyborg's receptor circuit for 5 seconds, dealing 10 fire damage. Spit has a new projectile icon. Aliens can now properly attack monkeys, dealing heavy damage. Can now interact with other aliens via attack. Larva cannot interact as such. Currently bugged where two similar messages show up on interaction. Will be fixed asap. Slightly higher damage to cyborgs. Aliens can now caress cyborgs with their scythe-like arms. Slightly higher damage to exosuits. Invisibility now works for 15 seconds instead of 30. Resin wall now costs 100 plasma instead of 200. Face huggers now have 10 health instead of 25. There is also a 30% chance of not being paralyzed after a facehugger leap. The paralysis itself lasts half as long. Aliens can now break glass, grills, and tables, and light fixtures without using acid. Adult aliens can now also climb over tables/racks. Fixed the acid verb not properly showing up. Fixed stab/disarm never properly showing up. Larva now get a verb to hide under tables as the old code didn't work. More alien emote fixes. Larva should now properly be gender neutral. General changes: Devouring time has been extended so it takes 10 seconds for all mobs. You must remain still (and the target), to devour someone. Hulks can break through grills a lot faster than before. Added smoothwall shuttle code by Urist (and icons by Rolfero). Added a new dmi for gimmick items. Moved a few gimmick items there. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@694 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Adjustments to alien acid. Aliens should no longer see invalid targets as one of their acid options when using the verb. Right clicking should give the invalid target message when appropriate. Made a bunch of other things acid proof. Bullets, lasers, runes, etc. Aliens should no longer emote as male when they are gender neuter. Or maybe plural, who knows. Tweaked respawn character verb.

 Fixed aliens spitting corrosive acid on objects that make no sense (singularities, shield walls, etc). Their corrosive acid should be reworked in the future, along with aliens in general. Fixed the Syndie hull door computer so they cannot use it if the shuttle is not near SS13. Should still be operable by PDA regardless. Probably a good idea to change that computer entirely in the future. Ripley files left unchecked since they don't compile. Fixed an improper overlay pipe on the map, near Xenobiology.

 Made atmos alerts slightly more sensible. Introduced a new sprite for the atmos alarms (orange) that goes off when there is reason to be "cautious" in an area, i.e atmos is abnormal but not critical, or when a critical atmos alert is active in the area. In addition, improved fire alarm sprites. When an alert is active, the alarm will have a red blinking light in lieu of the green light. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@681 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Changelong: More tweaks to death commandos. More work on CentCom. Fixed turret control issue for AI. Station blueprints now spawn in CE's locker. Power control modules placed on the map. More shield generator stuff by Barhandar: shield walls and shield wall generators now respect bullets and they (bullets) have chance to get past the shield. This also means you can power shield generators through emitters but it takes two to make a generator stable. Misc map changes. Re-check gimmick closets so they no longer spawn empty. Added a new admin button under Special Verbs. Allows to easily respawn a player (as an assistant) if their original body was gibbed. Currently doesn't set player preferences.

Pulse rifles can also gib them. * Fixed lizardman emotes. * New cake sprites by matty406 (carrot cake my edit of his cheese and regular cake). * Shuttle can be called in Malf and Revolution modes.

 Fixing some issues where the atmos sensor was too sensitive. Only change is with CO2 at this point, may or may not adjust that in the future. Resolved what appears to be an old bug with the CO2 detection system causing alerts for CO2 at 0.05kPa and 0.1kPa when the minimum value to cause harm is 10kPa. Updated values to 5 and 10 kPa for minor/severe alerts respectively. Also introduced detection for "unknown gases", which basically consists of N2O. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@665 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Prisoner Management Update: * New Implant: Chem. Insert up to 10 units of chemicals into implant with a syringe (while still in implant case) and then can use a prisoner management console to trigger 1, 5, or 10 units of the chemical to be injected into the implanted subject. Once all the chemicals are used up, the implant disables itself. * Prisoner Management Console can now detect the approximate location of prisoners with tracking implants in them. It gives slightly more useful information then the tracker but isn't portable. * AI cannot access Prisoner Management Console (unless malf/XISC). * Prisoner Management Console re-added to Armory (It no longer can trigger explosive implants). Play nice or else you'll get your toys taken away from you. BORK BORK update: * Re-did ChemMaster. Now it allows you transfer reagents in and out of a buffer. You can then turn the contents of the buffer into either a pill or a bottle. When removing reagents from the buffer, you can either delete them entirely or return them to the beaker. However, removing the beaker clears the contents of the buffer (so no mixing inside the ChemMaster!). CondiMaster Neo is almost identical to the ChemMaster except it only makes condiment bottles (no pills). * Milk now being handled like the other reagents (as intended). Remember: 5 units of milk = 1 cup. * Soymilk interchangable with regular milk in microwave recipes. (again, 5 units = 1 cup) * Xenomeatbread! 3 xeno meat, 3 cheese, 3 flour. Extra Heretical! * Monkey related food items renamed to generic meat (since I'm adding animals, I really don't want to add a new food items for every single new animal). * Cola removed from fridge. Thematically appropriate but it just clutters it up (especially since there are vending machines all over the damn place). * Faggots removed from meat locker. Instead, a small amount of meat spawns in there. * Carp processes modified. Code is a littles cleaner (lawl) and the random pathing a a little cleaner as well. Badmin Update: * By request, Admins can now trigger radiation event. * Confirmation warning on admin-triggered carp event. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@660 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Moved several malf-related sections of code from the general AIize() proc to malfunction's post_setup() to allow for only one AI to be picked as malf, not that it matters, since it turns out that the job assigning code's extra gubbins to make sure an AI is picked in malf also has the side effect of hard capping the number of AIs to one, at least until I get enough sleep to try tackling that. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@659 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Improvements to air alarms and atmospheric alerts. Minor bug fixes with fire alarms. Air alarms will now display atmospheric information to anyone. Air alarms will not automatically trigger atmos alarms similar to that of a fire alarm. Can also be manually activated by silicon mobs and those with atmos tech access. Atmos alert must be deactivated manually by silicon mobs or those with atmos tech access. Improved effects for the atmos alert and when an atmos and fire alert occur simultaneously. Silicon mobs should now receive an alert when an atmos alarm is triggered. Two bug fixes with fire alarms: One was preventing borgs from using them at a distance, the other was giving borgs a starred alarm interface, which was silly. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@655 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Implants, Explosions, and Carps, Oh my! - New Implant: Explosive. Implant it into a prisoner and you can detonate it remotely from a Prisoner Management console (located on the prison station and in the Armory). Armor access required to activate the explosives. A box of the implants is located on the prison station and another in the Armory. WARNING: Implantation of a subject who hasn't been convicted of a felony is a felony under the Space Code of Justice. Detonation of an individual may be considered murder as if they were killed by any other method. - Wardens office rearranged so that it's easier to get around and you don't accidentally open the door so much. - Spess Carp! OH SHIT. You can beat them up assuming they don't eat you first. Can be found wandering in space. Be careful: They're fast and smart. - New Random Event: "Unknown biological entities have been detected on the station, Please Stand By." - Chicks! Can't do anything with them yet but they're cute! - Poppy and Corn sprites added (growing, full grown, harvested, wilted, seeds, etc). Red, Green, and Yellow gelatin (because jell=o is copyrighted) sprites also added. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@601 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 You can now stick IDs in PDAs. If you look at your PDA window, there should be an option to stick an ID in, like with some computers. While carrying an ID, a PDA can be used for almost everything an ID can. While ID scanners can read cards through a PDA, it is difficult to shove a PDA into the ID slot on some computers. It is possible I missed some functions, but I was quite thorough in my sweep through the code. In the event of PDA destruction, any inserted ID is ejected unharmed. It is now possible to stick PDAs in your jumpsuit's ID slot. Since PDAs are named, you can disguise yourself as someone else using one. Beepsky/ED-209 can see through a PDA disguise if you stick your real ID in for access. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@592 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 New rune: reveal runes. Opposite to "conceal", reveals all hidden runes in large radius. Possible to imbue into a talisman. Words are same as conceal rune, but in reversed order. Chaplain can now hit floor with his bible to reveal hidden runes in small radius around him. Tweaks to cultist game mode: Words that arent commonly used are never revealed to cultists on game start.

 More changes to malf modules. Machine Overload and Reactivate Camera now only work on the appropriate items. Making the verb only show up on the proper items is a far more intensive (if even possible) effort. The Blackout module is now more likely to hit areas that previous attempts failed to overload.

 Misc Stuff: * False walls now should update their lighting properly. * False Walls now require 2 metal to finish instead of 1. NO MORE FREE METAL FOR YOU. * False R-walls are now creatable. Instead of using regular metal when making a false wall, just use R-metal. It's still functionally identical to a regular false wall. * Reinforcing Girders with R-Metal actually uses up a sheet of r-metal rather then just fairy dust. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@508 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Hydroponics + ect Update: * Hydroponics area re-arranged to require less running around. * Both Nettles and Death Nettles now can be used in a blender to extact their reagents. * Seeds Crates can now be ordered by the QM. Contains a packet of all the basic seeds available from the seed vendor. * Exotic Seeds Crates can now be ordered by the QM. Contains one packet of the following each: Egg Plant, Nettle, Fly Amanita Mycelium, Liberty Cap Mycelium, Plump Helmet Mycelium * "Egg Plant" added (not a typo). Eggs may not be used on Seed Extractor to make Egg Seeds (that would just be silly). The only way to get an Egg Plant is through mutating an Eggplant or an Exotic Seeds crate. * Plant-b-gone spray bottles now kill weeds and pests better then before. Also slightly less toxic. * Weed spray and Pest Spray both removed since they're redundant. * Potatos added. Can be used to make Fries (Potato + Processor), Cheesy Fries (Microwave: Fries + 1 cheese), Loaded Baked Potato (Microwave: 1 Potato + 1 Cheese) * Beaker I intended to add in previous update finally got added (in kitchen). * AI can no longer pick plants in hydroponics.

 The Over 9000 Food + Misc Update: * Private meeting room attached to cafe! * Starkist was somehow set to 0 in the vending machine. Fixed. * Sleepy pen has been modified, it now puts people to sleep *near* instantly but only once. Cost increased slightly. Holds a signficantly lower amount of reagents. Might have to tone down the amount based on playtesting. * Changed/removed some station radios that weren't loading properly (station radio frequencies cannot be set lower then 144.1 by default, FYI). * Sodium now available from Chem Dispenser. * New Condiment: Olive Oil (Graphic By Thedoorman). A bottle of it added to the kitchen (use wisely, there's only one). * Minor food reagent tweaks. Now drinking too much soda will make you fat as well. * New Device: Blender. It turns food items into reagents (Soybeans => Soy Milk, Berries => Berry Juice, Most grown items => Nutriment + Whatever, etc.) and acts as a container. Just stick the food items in, and select the "blend" option from the right-click menu. * New Reagents: Universal Enzyme (Used in food production, a single bottle of it is in the kitchen), Soy Milk (Used in cooking, can be made from a blender or obtained from a carton in the food locker), Berry Juice (used to make wine and jelly donuts), Chloral Hydrate (a powerful sedative, treat it with anti-toxin. Won't always wake instantly but you up but you'll wake up faster) * New food/drink items: Tofu * New Reactions: Create Tofu (10 soy milk + 2 universal enzyme), Create Wine (5 Berry Juice + 2 Universal Enzyme), Create Moonshine (5 nutriment + 2 universal enzyme), Create Cheese Wheel (40 milk + 2 universal enzyme), Create Chloral Hydrate (3 chlorine + 1 water + 1 ethanol), Create Soysauce (1 soymilk + 1 sulfuric acid) * Condiment containers now transfer 1 unit rather then 2. Beaker added to kitchen (to aid in mixing). * Condiment bottles now work similarly to drinking glasses: They change based on their contents. A box of blank/empty ones can be found in the kitchen backroom and more can be ordered from the QM. * Processor no longer produces hotsauce, coldsauce, or soysauce. Use a blender to make them instead. Because of this change, it now takes multiples of a particular item to fill a bottle. PROTIP: High potency chilis/icepeppers produce more condiment then low potency ones. * ChemMaster added to kitchen backroom to "purify" blender mixtures, door to kitchen backroom from cafe room removed. * New recipe: Tofu Bread (3 tofu + 3 flour + 3 cheese). Can be sliced just like meatbread. * Microwave recipe changes: Instead adding entire containers full (or empty!) of reagents to the microwave, you instead just add a specific amount. For milk and sauces (berryjuice/ketchup/soy/hot/cold), it's 5 unit of the milk/sauce instead of 1 container. It's lenient with reagents so if you put in too much you'll be fine. * Processor Change: No longer makes cheese wheels. * Berry Jam replaced with berry juice in Jelly Donut recipes. Berry Jam removed entirely. Note: Sorry if my new icons look like ass. Microwave/processor changes kind of half-assed. Intend to overhaul them next (more ROBUST!). Since a lot of kichen stuff is mess around, i'll update the wiki... soon. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@490 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Misc Updates: - Silly error in medical code. Now ointment will actually heal fire damage properly. - Removed fork from the kitchen since all it does is stab you in the face when you try to eat with it. - New Reagent: Sodium - Table Salt renamed "Sodium Chloride" for SCIENCE! You can make it by mixing sodium and chlorine. - Some reagents rearranged in reagents file. Food Overhaul Phase 2: - You can now add condiments from condiment containers to food! You may also inject (but not remove) substances into food with a syringe. - Bitesize variable redone. Now bites eat half the remaining contents of the food to a minimum of 1 or the bitesize. Otherwise, it'd be REALLY obvious when you've doctored food. - New Items: Salt Shaker, Pepper Mill (both used to season food). (Sprites by Deuryn) Both added to cafe. - Bug (possibly) of alcohol not metabolizing properly (possibly) fixed. - New snacks and beverages!

 Camera fixes by XSI Power grid fixes. All the areas should receive power from SMES and properly show up on the monitor. Teleporter to Courtroom by Callagan. It has been placed in the Brig, replacing Brig cells 7 and 8. One way teleporter to the Court. Do not put people hold people in the Prison Station unless they are: Nuke operatives OR given a trial in the COURTROOM. Barman can once again access his locker. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@439 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 The wires I added to cyborgs now do stuff! Two wires do nothing, until such a time as I come up with decent things for them to do. One wire controls the borg's LawSync protocol. Severing this wire disables law updates. Pulsing it forces an update of the borg's laws. Last wire controls the borg's AI link. Severing the wire severs the borg's link to its AI if it had one. It retains any custom laws it happened to have picked up from the AI. Pulsing the wire forces it to choose an AI to link with. TO ACCESS THE WIRES: 1) Unlock the borg's panel with a roboticist-access ID 2) Open the panel with a crowbar 3) Expose the wiring with a screwdriver 4) Attack the borg with wirecutters or a multitool to make the window pop up git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@436 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Fixes: Wiring and APCs should work properly now. The SMES batteries are also properly connected to the power grid thanks to Muskets. Engine should stay contained. The crew cabins were made larger and reduced in number to a total of 8. The Prison shuttle now works thanks to Callagan. Robotics is now the man-cave once again. Virology airlock should be working and Med Bay features anesthetic as before. There are more comm radios around that station. Atmos is now color-coded on top of walls as requested in the forum. Beepsky should patrol normally now. Other fixes. Issues: Toilets will still likely lack air until they are properly coded. The crew cabins are not ID locked until they are coded. The brig does not feature a button for prisoners to leave until coded. Showers are missing until coded. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@430 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Started work on some cyborg updates I've had planned for a while. Cyborgs now only receive law changes from their AI when they check their laws. In practice, this only matters if the AI dies or is intelicarded (or if the borg's law sync wire is cut once I get that coded) in the time between the law being uploaded and the borg checking its laws. Cyborgs now have four wires that are randomized each round, much like in an airlock or APC. Currently, these wires do nothing and cannot be interacted with, but its getting late and I need sleep. It is planned for one of these wires to control law syncing, another to control AI linkage, and the other two to either do nothing or short out the powercell Moved the borg/ai law-related code to separate files for convenience git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@429 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Finally committing the map from the thread below: http://tgstation13.servehttp.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=229 It includes the necessary resources and area adjustments. The main map is tgstation.1.3.1.dmm I have also included a testing map under backup, called JunkMap.dmm. Feel free to dump your WIP mapping in there. Included with this revision is another job (the Warden) which is in the code but will not available at the job select screen. Stuff that I would like to have in the new map: ***Working prison shuttle. *ID locked crew cabins. Slide card on door, enter Cabin. Door is locked on that ID only. **Button in Brig to open one set of the sliding glass doors (so prisoners can let themselves out when their time is up). *One-way teleporter between Sec and Court-room to deliver prisoners. An easy alternative to this is simply to create a two-way disposal unit. The drawbacks is that one can ride it regardless of clearance and it hurls people upon exit (into obstacles doing damage). *Toilets--flush small items only, works like a disposal unit. *Updated derelict. Still not finished. *detonates importance. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@424 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Food/Drink Overhaul Phase 1: Vast majority of the changes are transparent to players. - Healing on all food items have been adjusted. This means food heals for more generally (also because the old code always healed 1 damage regardless of what the food was designed to do). The strength of secondary effects (such as heat from chilis or the extra healing from donuts) has generally changed (donk pockets currently only heal their basic amount, I think). - Poisonous shrooms are still potentially lethal but you'll have time to respond to their effect. - Redundancies removed from all over the place. - New reagents: Nutriment, Ketchup, Soy Sauce, Salt, Pepper, Capsaicin Oil, Frost Oil, Amatoxin, Psilocybin, Sprinkles - Preparation for condiments - Fixed Gulp_Size related stuff. - New Food Item: Chaos Donut: 1 Hot Sauce + 1 Cold Sauce + 1 Flour + 1 Egg. Has a variable effect. NOT DEADLY (usually). - New Drug: Ethylredoxrazine: Carbon + Oxygen + Anti-Toxin. Binds strongly with Ethanol *HINT* - Changelog updated. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@423 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 More work on buildable piping Manifolds, unary vents, scrubbers, manual valves, connectors, and pumps are now also makable testing has not been overly robust thus far Known issues: scrubbers don't seem to be able to grab nodes properly when constructed runtime errors if you try making a pipe/manifold that doesn't connect to an already-constructed atmos object corner pipe sections have a tendency to defy euclidian logic (most notable example has been a section of pipe that somehow had both ends tied to the same end of a different pipe section) Added a disposal pipe dispenser that had been sitting unused in the code to Atmos. No clue if it actually works, I know the regular pipe dispenser worked fine Did NOT add a pipe dispenser to the map, but it is there if admins want to spawn one git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@396 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Tweaked the intelicard so you can tell when an AI wipe is in progress. Made sure you can't offload an AI that is being wiped, mainly so I don't have to deal with working out any code fuckups that might happen as a result. Removed redundant code from the AI fixer. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@144 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 The AI fixer should now properly set an AI's stat to 0 once it has been repaired enough to not die. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@143 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Fix for people complaining about "who" and "adminwho" verbs. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@142 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Restored ooc, asay, and dsay to their easier to use forms. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@141 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Added an AI System Integrity Restorer to the RD's office Stick an AI into it via intelicard, then push button to begin repair process. AI unable to interact with things while in there. Can revive dead AIs, but you won't be able to stick it back into its core until I come up with a way to repair damaged cores. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@140 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Added the ability to build new AI cores. Construction starts with a stack of 4 rmetal From there, wrench, AI core circuitboard, screwdriver, wirecoil, a stack of 2 rglass, screwdriver Between adding the wiring and the rglass, it is possible to insert a brain to create a new AI. If no brain is included, you get an Inactive AI. It is also possible to use the Asimov, Purge, and Freeform law modules on a core at this stage. A new AI will not have any laws if you don't add any! Deconstruction is currently impossible once it is a full AI, but until the securing of the rglass is done, you can still take it apart. Assuming you've inserted the rglass, deconstruction is crowbar, crowbar (only if you inserted a brain), wirecutters, screwdriver, wrench, welder It currently has really fugly sprites because I am not a spriter Added ability to stack rmetal. Added AI core circuitboard to tech storage. Commented out some debug code that was no longer needed. This is the biggest update I've done, it seems to be compiling fine on my end, but for all I know shit will ass up once it hits the SVN. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@139 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Removed files that were 0 bytes in size. Made sure every verb now has a name which starts with a capital letter and makes sense, because OCD. Changed the categories of verbs a lot, now they are in much more sensible tabs. Added a couple of admin verbs: - Right click monkeyize - Call Shuttle - Recall Shuttle Removed some goon verbs. Gave "Coder" admin group a little more admin verbs: - Monkeyize, Cultistize, Abominationize, Call Shuttle, Recall Shuttle, Make Sound Added mobs a "say_message" variable. Now admin-created mobs can "scree", "squeak" etc. instead of just "chimper" or "hiss". git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@138 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Added a new iconstate for empty AI cores. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@137 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Added an option to allow an intelicarded AI to interact with electronic devices. This currently reaches anywhere the AI can see, the range might get toned down. The little yellow light on the intelicard turns green when the AI is allowed to interact with things. Removed the malfunction timer, as apparently it makes it too hard on the AI. This will likely get replaced with something different (and more IC) later. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@136 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Dead AIs can be intelicarded again. This does NOT return them to a functional state if they have been destroyed, it is simply a framework for the eventual ability to make new AIs and/or repair damaged ones. Added an icon state for intelicards with a dead AI. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@133 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Added: Numbers' hydroponics syringe injections: Now you can put chemical solutions into hydrotrays and plants will react accordingly. Minihoe for uprooting weeds safely. Added to hydroponics trays. Changed: Advanced ProcCall proc, now actually somewhat useful. Blob expands faster again. Slight Plant-b-Gone buff against alien weeds. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@125 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Intelicarding an AI no longer causes two sets of AI laws to be reported at round-end. You can now view the laws of an Intelicarded AI, and initiate a wipe of its files, killing it. Further functionality, such as giving it the ability to talk over a radio, is planned. It is no longer possible to use an Intelicard on an AI core that has already had its AI removed. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@124 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Added pirate outfits to gimmick.dm by popular demand, since we had the sprites. Also, Botanists now spawn with an apron. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@123 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Powersinks now stop draining the station's power when you disconnect them from the wire they were attached to. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@122 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 New spraycan, hoe and spaceworms icons, including hold icons. Singularity now changes sprite to a more violent one when not contained. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@121 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Possible fix for the mysterious invisible decoy AI, since I can't reproduce the bug to begin with on my test server, no clue if this actually works. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@119 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 New: Aliens now bleed green when you hit them. The green blood can be mopped and cleaned. Hurt people and bodies leave behind blood when you drag them. Monkeys now also bleed when struck with items. Added variable "update_icon" for mobs. Basically you can now change the icon on aliens and monkeys as an admin and it will not change back when you move around. You can spawn monkey and alien "RolePlay" bodies which have update_icon = 0 at start. Fixed: Monkeys not slipping on wet floor and causing runtime errors. Monkeys and Aliens not being able to speak on station bounced radios or intercoms and causing runtime errors. Anything else than humans not being able to attack humans with items (did no damage). Food sometimes dealing damage when you eat it (such as chips). Changed: Alien weeds and the blob now spread at a reasonable pace. Removed some redundant code, such as what was left of poo and urine. Removed nutrient.dm again, someone brought it back at some point, it's redundant. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@118 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Added the Lawyer office. Added accesslevel 38, access_lawyer. Gave Robotics an APC. Made Toxins mixing room into a separate area, as it already had its own APC and having two APCs in the Toxin Lab area was causing weirdness.

 Added IRC details and Google Code page to the changelog popup. This would have been in the previous revision but I forgot, derp. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@8 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e

 Traitor/Rev Head clowns lose the clumsy gene. This means that Rev Head clowns can convert people without dropping their flash. It also allows such gamemode-sanctioned naughty clowns to use looted security gear without fucking themselves over 50% of the time. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@6 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Modified the State Laws verb such that the AI can selectively not report some laws, so they don't have to manually copy/paste its laws when given a law they aren't supposed to report. The Reset and Purge AI modules can now remove OneHuman laws. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@5 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
 Turned the non-functional Engineering Engine Monitor PDA app into a remote power monitor. Requires a functioning power monitor computer, if it's broken another should take over automatically if it exists or when you build one. First one to start up is the one that sends data to PDAs for now. Tested multiple power monitors at once, bombing and replacing computer. Didn't test dismantling the computer to see if that triggers the breaking code because it doesn't seem to be possible with this version of the power monitor. git-svn-id: http://tgstation13.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@4 316c924e-a436-60f5-8080-3fe189b3f50e
