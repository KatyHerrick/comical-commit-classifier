You can also add a signaling device to it, in case you want it to report it's location as well. It also sends a final message when connected the security channel upon detonation. The keys/signaling device can be ejected with a screwdriver, but that cannot be done while it is locked/anchored. A signaling device now spawns within the security office.

Commit #610 remove_from_active now handles unsimulated turfs properly (because if they are in the active turf list, they should get removed!)
Commit #611 Fixes ssair trying to proc unsimulated turfs. An active/excited simulated turf would get deleted and converted to space, so this would change the turf in ssair's active_turfs list to a space turf, then it would runtime trying to call process_cell on it. (why byond!) Before a : and some lack of caring and a type check handled this. I removed this thinking it wasn't needed when i did my lag fix. (My exact thought was "why would an unsimulated turf get in ssair's active turf list, that seems like a bug that shouldn't get hidden" i forgot that deleting a turf just converts it to a space turf and all existing references are updated by byond to point to the new space turf) this OOP way seems better anyways.

Commit #1013 Fixed Preternis not metabolizing any nutritious reagents. They now metabolize them normally except that they receive 1/5th the nutrient from them. The message they receive when they eat food has been changed to appear once every two minutes if there is a nutritious reagent in their system, instead of on a 1% probability per tick there is a nutritious reagent in their system.

Commit #1048 *Replaced the tactical carp harness in the nukeops uplink with the universal tactical animal harness, which can be placed on carp or dolphins. Moved the code that makes the animal sentient to the universal harness. *Added tactical carp sprite. *Tactical carps now shoot heavy lasers instead of regular ones, and have 300 health instead of 150. *Tactical dolphins now shoot 3 regular lasers instead of one per click, and now move about 50% faster than an unencumbered human. *Adding or removing a harness leaves the animal at the same percent health instead of fully healing it. *Made it so you can't walk past carps while on help intent. *Fixed some bugs.

The tacitcal dolphin spawner for nukeops has been replaced with the tactical carp harness. *upon putting the harness on a carp, it will attempt to give it sentience. This effect can only succeed once. If it has not succeeded yet, you can refund it. *only works on regular carp, not any subtypes.

While wearing the harness, the dolphin has: *toggleable emag and night vision. *inventory the size of a backpack. The dolphin cannot put items in it, but any human can through the strip menu. The only way to remove items are to have the dolphin drop them, or remove the harness, which takes a human 6 seconds. *laser that shoots swarmer speed (once every 3 life ticks) and never runs out of charge. It has support for multiple weapons it can cycle through, but there is only the one installed by default.
